Jaap Blonk,Ingletwist Fragments [CAA-030],"""Just like I have a parallel language to that of the Netherlands, the so-called 'Onderlands', I have one for English: 'Ingletwist'. It's a nonsense language, it has no meaning, just associations here and there. For each of the 9 tracks of this album I made a text in the following manner. I did a gibberish improvisation, focusing on the 3 sounds that are in the title of the track: one vowel or diphtong and two consonants sounds. For instance, for ""Ahtsh"" it was 'ah', 't' and 'sh', and 'i', 'ng' and 'z' became ""Eyengz"". While doing this, I fed my efforts into the dictation facility of my computer, and watched with glee how it desperately worked on making English words out of them. I saved the texts I got in this way, and then mildly scrambled them into Ingletwist. These results were used for the vocals I recorded, treated in a very loose way, allowing myself room for improvisation again. I also recorded the texts as spoken by different computer voices, and in each track one of them makes a short appearance. For the electronics I used analog equipment exclusively. There's a warmth and imperfection there that I like very much, and often I hear voices in these sounds where there's actually nothing vocal at all."" - Jaap Blonk.",Catalytic Sound,https://jaapblonkkontrans.bandcamp.com/album/ingletwist-fragments,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/jaap-blonk-ingletwist-fragments-caa-030/s-O9OWWQ3Al94

Mark Cisneros / Nik Francis / Luke Stewart,We Were Here Before [CAA​-​032],"This extended work consists of both composition and group improvisation. It is a collection of themes attempting to express deeply rooted feelings about the now and what has been. A collective memory of sorts. Or perhaps a kind of collective consciousness or genetic memory. This recording is an expression of this. Memories, reflections, and meditations on our ancestral experience of being people of color in this country. This music is offered in the name of unity, identity, hope, and oneness. Mark Cisneros - Reeds, Percussion. Luke Stewart - Bass. Nik Francis - Drums.

Joe Morris & Joe McPhee,Era [CAA-033],"""While it is definitely a bold thing to ask Joe McPhee to record a duet with me on drums, my understanding of Joe and his unique approach to his instruments and to music in general made it a very logical decision. Joe McPhee is one of the few musicians I’ve known who is totally open to making music in any situation, with anyone. It seems to me that his main criteria is camaraderie and artistic credibility, simply put, a kind of “let’s do our best to make it sound good by working well together and helping each other” approach.. There’s never a weird burden of any specific technical demand, except maybe “please don’t box me in”. During the Saft session (which had me and Joe playing outside on an unusually warm November afternoon) Joe implied that I had done alright because I didn’t box him in. That said, I never would’ve asked him if I didn’t think I could do it.""",Catalytic Sound,https://joemorrisritiglacialeratic.bandcamp.com/album/era,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/era-caa-033/s-tfjAzL2OSxG
