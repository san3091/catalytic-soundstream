Joe McPhee Trio,Impressions of Jimmy Giuffre,"""This beautiful set is full of a unique tenderness, and comes out as a very personal statement that should not be missed."" -Alain Drouot, All Music",Catalytic Sound,https://joemcphee.bandcamp.com/album/impressions-of-jimmy-giuffre,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/impressions-of-jimmy-giuffre/s-ofZH0CdY8Q5
Paal Nilssen-Love,"The Quintet (July 8th, 1998)","“A recording which provides an exciting glimpse into Paal’s musical roots. In addition, it represents a historic transfer between a generation of musicians who came up with and played alongside Jan Garbarek and Arild Andersen, to those who would carry the Norwegian scene into the 21st century.” - Ken Vandermark. Carl Magnus Neumann: sax. Bjørnar Andresen: double bass. Eivind Opsvik: double bass. Ketil Gutvik: guitar.

Mats Gustafsson & Hamid Drake,For Don Cherry,"""Rhythmic virtuoso Hamid Drake and reeds innovator Mats Gustafsson deliver a jaw-dropping and all-too-brief set recorded in Chicago on Oct. 19, 1995, the day of Don Cherry’s death and recorded by Jim O'Rourke. One of the few live records to make this listener earnestly wish she’d been in attendance, Drake and Gustafsson’s meeting is a perfect example of the phenomenal synergy possible between two musicians. The two in question are an ideal match; both temper the muscularity of their playing with sensitivity and musical sophistication. Neither artist allows the other the option of sitting on his heels at any point; this recording is challenging, intense, and enjoyable from start to finish."" –Susie Jae, ON AIR magazine, WKCR 89.9 FM (New York)",Catalytic Sound,https://gustafsson1.bandcamp.com/album/for-don-cherry,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/for-don-cherry/s-CxZRQ0e9yEH

Henneman Strijkkwartet,Pes,"""The string quartet is an instrumental combination most often heard in many different genres of classical music; in fact, it is one of the standard groupings for this music, whereas it is a more rare enterprise in improvised music. Certainly there are examples of string players getting together to improvise, but the results can not so often be compared favorably with great classical string quartets. The Dutch viola player and composer Henneman is making great progress in this area however, as she has found a regular group of musicians to work with, evidenced by the six-year span of recording dates. The difficult task of integrating composition and improvisation is carried out with aplomb by this group: they actually make it sound easy. A nice combination of male and female energy exists in this group, as well as a combination of Dutch musicians and so-called ex-patriot Americans who have settled in the Netherlands. The players are comfortable working in a traditional, melodic, and harmonic manner but also can and do go way out. Everything that happens makes logical sense, and this is music that reveals rich layers of detail upon repeated listenings."" - Eugene Chadbourne (All Music)",Catalytic Sound,https://abbaarsighennemanwig.bandcamp.com/album/pes,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/pes/s-3Os70kM6UHr
