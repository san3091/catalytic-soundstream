Territory Band 4,Company Switch,"""Company Switch also succeeds as an emotionally charged diptych with Vandermark delving into personal experiences to create music that alternately exudes beauty and suffering. Highly recommended.""",Catalytic Sound,https://vandermark1.bandcamp.com/album/territory-band-4-company-switch,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/company-switch/s-ALLHl4JkoN2
Territory Band 6 with Fred Anderson,Collide,"Collide is Ken Vandermark's sixth release for his transatlantic small big band (or is it a large small group?) of American jazz meets European improvisers. Unlike the prior sessions, this disc is comprised of a single composition, divided into five parts and counts with the presence tenor saxophone giant, Fred Anderson.",Catalytic Sound,https://vandermark1.bandcamp.com/album/territory-band-6-with-fred-anderson-collide,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/collide/s-QXX3o705cWs
"Andy Moor, Anne James & Thurston Moore",Herectics,"Heretics is a series of portraits of radical heretical figures found throughout the history of schismatic thinking.Heretics like Caravaggio, William Burroughs, Jose Mujica, Marquis de Sade and Johnny Rotten, fascinated the artists. These influential figures are presented here in the form of poetic texts and catchy melodies combined with experimental noise. - With the addition of ex-Sonic Youth guitarist, singer and songwriter Thurston Moore, Anne-James Chaton and Andy Moor’s more than a decade long collaboration becomes an exciting trio. They researched and created the material for Heretics during a residency in the French port of St Nazaire, in July 2014. They used voice, guitars and electronics in solo, duo or trio, to collaboratively explore their ideas and co-write texts and music.",Catalytic Sound,https://andymoorunsounds.bandcamp.com/album/heretics,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/heretics/s-WKND8N5FaeW
Dave Rempis,The Covid Tapes,"THE COVID TAPES documents the efforts by saxophonist and label founder Dave Rempis to continue his creative output during a pandemic that gutted performance possibilities for artists across the globe. This two-cd set includes pieces from some of the many weekly solo performances he streamed from his broom closet-sized practice space at Unity Lutheran Church in the Edgewater neighborhood of Chicago from March-September of 2020. Those pieces buttress duo and trio performances mostly from outdoor concerts between July and early November that he organized on Friday evenings at Margate Park, two blocks from his house in the Uptown neighborhood. Those groupings include friends and regular collaborators Tomeka Reid - cello, Joshua Abrams - bass, Tim Daisy - drums, and Tyler Damon – drums.",Catalytic Sound,https://daverempiscatalyticsound.bandcamp.com/album/the-covid-tapes,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/the-covid-tapes/s-W8DLj9rTjo8
claire rousay & Alex Cunningham,Specifically The Water,“An extremely focused set of violin and percussion interactions made by Alex Cunningham and claire rousay. This duo creates a wide palette of sounds which shift and move in an organic and spirited fashion. Their attention to detail is microscopic. Highly recommended.” - Tim Daisy,Catalytic Sound,https://clairerousay1.bandcamp.com/album/specifically-the-water,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/alex-cunningham-claire-rousay-specifically-the-water/s-eXkuSEaUocr
Ballister,Mechanisms,"“Besides its unbridled intensity, Ballister seems possessed by positive spirits while gelling to the live element via an emotive, fluid, and overpowering set of protocols, offering thrills-a-nanosecond.” - Glenn Astarita, All About Jazz.

Fred Lonberg-Holm & Ken Vandermark,Resistence,"""Fred Lonberg-Holm and Ken Vandermark are like a small band on this album, tight, voluminous, ideally matched, often it seems as if the music was pre-composed (but all of it is freely improvised). The music is like a dance between a songbird (cello) and a belling deer (tenor saxophone), sometimes their energy literally collides."" -Martin Schray, Free Jazz Blog",Catalytic Sound,https://vandermark1.bandcamp.com/album/resistance,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/resistance/s-DiKkE2gHTUC

Recorded at the Loft in Cologne both in concert and ""in the studio"" during December 2008, this album contains 22 pieces of Improvised Music that run the gamut of expressive energy and melodic power, as well as a composition by Brötzmann and Jimmy Giuffre.""",Catalytic Sound,https://vandermark1.bandcamp.com/album/call-before-you-dig,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/call-before-you-dig/s-OxXRB4S1cnG
Ab Baars Trio,Verderame,"""Netherlands reed king Ab Baars has played with everyone from Guus Janssen to Franz Koglmann and led his own wonderfully playful avant quartet. But Verderame marks his first outing unaccompanied and takes an unusual understated tack. Over the course of nine originals -- many of them tributes to friends and inspirations -- and a gorgeous reworking of Billy Strayhorn's ""Lotus Blossom,"" Baars offers a wonderfully personal album of warm reflections, tender microtonal explorations, and quick-witted charm."" -Thom Jurek, All Music",Catalytic Sound,https://abbaarsighennemanwig.bandcamp.com/album/verderame,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/verderame/s-3umgso8TCaa
Flow Trio,Rejuvenation,"""If there is a way—and there most certainly is—to feel music with all the senses, then Flow Trio, comprising saxophonist Louie Belogenis, bassist Joe Morris and percussionist Charles Downs, show how completely spectacular this can feel when it all comes together on a record such as Rejuvenation. The group, all seriously schooled in the poetics of sound, have literally mastered the way to fully explore the sound dynamic of saxophone, bass and drum, vertically- -for harmonic depth—and horizontally—to toy with the melodic elasticity."" -Raul d'Gama Rose, All About Jazz",Catalytic Sound,https://joemorrisritiglacialeratic.bandcamp.com/album/rejuvenation,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/rejuvemnation/s-vtPEsAC1prF
