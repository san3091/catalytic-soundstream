Ken Vandermark's Joe Harriott Project,Straight Lines,"""The tunes are filled with odd time signiatures, quirky stops and meaty lines that make for excellent improvisation on the part of Vandermark, Jeb Bishop on trombone, Kent Kessler on bass and Tim Mulvenna on drums. A strong tribute.""  -Tom Sheridan, AllMusic",CS,https://vandermark1.bandcamp.com/album/straight-lines,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/straight-lines/s-ovr52dNECwH
Joe McPhee Trio,Impressions of Jimmy Giuffre,"""This beautiful set is full of a unique tenderness, and comes out as a very personal statement that should not be missed."" -Alain Drouot, All Music",CS,https://joemcphee.bandcamp.com/album/impressions-of-jimmy-giuffre,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/impressions-of-jimmy-giuffre/s-ofZH0CdY8Q5
Trio X,The Watermelon Suite,"""McPhee is such a versatile player that sparks fly whether he blows a saxophone or trumpet. Here, he performs solely on the soprano sax, joined by bassist Dominic Duval and percussionist Jay Rosen. The mood is generally more pensive than to be expected, although fires are lit in a few of the pieces. McPhee shows himself to be a thoughtful, sensitive player, where every note counts and space is just as important."" -Steve Loewy, AllMusic",CS,https://joemcphee.bandcamp.com/album/the-watermelon-suite,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/the-watermelon-suite/s-O6hwUDZMmnL
Mats Gustafsson & Hamid Drake,For Don Cherry,"""Rhythmic virtuoso Hamid Drake and reeds innovator Mats Gustafsson deliver a jaw-dropping and all-too-brief set recorded in Chicago on Oct. 19, 1995, the day of Don Cherry’s death and recorded by Jim O'Rourke. One of the few live records to make this listener earnestly wish she’d been in attendance, Drake and Gustafsson’s meeting is a perfect example of the phenomenal synergy possible between two musicians. The two in question are an ideal match; both temper the muscularity of their playing with sensitivity and musical sophistication. Neither artist allows the other the option of sitting on his heels at any point; this recording is challenging, intense, and enjoyable from start to finish."" –Susie Jae, ON AIR magazine, WKCR 89.9 FM (New York)",CS,https://gustafsson1.bandcamp.com/album/for-don-cherry,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/for-don-cherry/s-CxZRQ0e9yEH
Henneman Strijkkwartet,Pes,"""The string quartet is an instrumental combination most often heard in many different genres of classical music; in fact, it is one of the standard groupings for this music, whereas it is a more rare enterprise in improvised music. Certainly there are examples of string players getting together to improvise, but the results can not so often be compared favorably with great classical string quartets. The Dutch viola player and composer Henneman is making great progress in this area however, as she has found a regular group of musicians to work with, evidenced by the six-year span of recording dates. The difficult task of integrating composition and improvisation is carried out with aplomb by this group: they actually make it sound easy. A nice combination of male and female energy exists in this group, as well as a combination of Dutch musicians and so-called ex-patriot Americans who have settled in the Netherlands. The players are comfortable working in a traditional, melodic, and harmonic manner but also can and do go way out. Everything that happens makes logical sense, and this is music that reveals rich layers of detail upon repeated listenings."" - Eugene Chadbourne (All Music)",CS,https://abbaarsighennemanwig.bandcamp.com/album/pes,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/pes/s-3Os70kM6UHr
Joe Morris Quartet,Underthru,"""it is the most overtly jazz-based recording in the Morris catalog... Underthru swings and grooves and leaves a lot of space for interaction."" -Larry Appelbaum, JazzTimes",CS,https://joemorrisritiglacialeratic.bandcamp.com/album/underthru,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/underthru/s-UTPXEBJJ5P6
"Joe Morris, Ken Vandermark & Hans Poppel",Like Rays,"""There are moments of subtle understatement as well as bursting intensity, and it all flows along with the collective intent that characterizes free music (or any kind of jazz) when it's really happening."" -JazzTimes",CS,https://vandermark1.bandcamp.com/album/like-rays,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/like-rays/s-tGGoDeyzqz5
The Ex,Mudbird Shivers,"""The Ex is still growing, maturing, learning and blowing most other bands off the stage. They have a devastating sense of rhythm and a far-reaching lyrical intelligence.""",CS,https://terriehesselsterprecords.bandcamp.com/album/mudbird-shivers,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/mudbird-shivers/s-kn48h4jyOa3
Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd,Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd,"This is an album produced by Mats Gustafsson and Thomas Millroth and it's a unique document of the artist's work with spoken word and poetry, mixed with avant garde editing and sound processing. A special album for the curious spirits!",CS,https://gustafsson1.bandcamp.com/album/carl-fredrik-reutersw-rd,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/carl-fredrik-reutersward/s-GiPJTLutuOC
Joe McPhee,Legend Street One,"""The current forms are transmuted, offering glimpses of the newer tonal frontiers he has encountered, but the sonorities aside, the feeling of the music remains, with a similar emphasis placed on timbres that highlight rather than consume either a melodic line or an improvisation."" -Thom Jurek, All Music",CS,https://joemcphee.bandcamp.com/album/legend-street-one,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/legend-street-one/s-tcZeTsr8lJw
