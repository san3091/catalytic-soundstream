Ab Baars,A Free Step: The Music of John Carter,"“Baars is clearly pursuing his own voice through this demanding, rewarding material; in this regard, his outings on tenor provide a necessary contrast. His colleagues are well-suited for the project: Wilbert de Joode is a powerful bass player, whose work is often strongly felt before the notes are fully articulated in the mind; and Martin van Duynhoven is a solid ensemble player who pushes the music with shrewd cross rhythms. They are a trio that does justice to the music of John Carter."" –Bill Shoemaker, Jazz Times",Catalytic Sound,https://abbaarsighennemanwig.bandcamp.com/album/a-free-step-the-music-of-john-carter,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/ab-baars-trio-a-free-step-the-music-of-john-carter/s-cgilVOOPQ1d

Atomic / School Days,Nuclear Assembly Hall,"“The two-CD set Atomic / School Days is steeped in composition. This is music that is heavily composed and precisely played. There is no allowance here for mistakes. Over the course of almost two hours, the octet presents the listener with broad-minded and open-ended themes. Once again, everyone is allowed to stretch out, to play their very brief solos, but this time, there is tight structure. Structure is not a bad thing necessarily. In this context, Nuclear Assembly Hall shines through.” -Tom Sekowski, Exclaim!",Catalytic Sound,https://vandermark1.bandcamp.com/album/atomic-school-days-nuclear-assembly-hall,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/ken-vandermark-atomic-school-days-nuclear-assembly-hall/s-A6EW2e5IXQp
Paal Nilssen-Love & Ken Vandermark,Seven,"“When Paal Nilssen-Love and Ken Vandermark take the stage for two uninterrupted sets, you know there's no chance they'll take the easy route. They put themselves on the spot as a duet and as individual performers, asking telling questions about the way their instruments are played; where the boundaries are, sonically, expressively, physically.” – London Jazz News",Catalytic Sound,https://vandermark1.bandcamp.com/album/ken-vandermark-paal-nilssen-love-seven,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/ken-vandermark-paal-nilssen-love-seven/s-TDO9PBpdiss
