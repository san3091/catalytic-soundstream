Paul Lytton,"""​?​"" ""​!​""","When I was a little kid, I had an LP of ""haunted house"" sound effects that would set my 8-year-old imagination off on a tear, envisioning ghastly scenarios attached to the sounds I was hearing. As an ""adult"" (nominally, at least), this record does something similar -- not that it's an album of sound effects or scenes from an imaginary horror movie, or anything so simple. More that it gorgonizes that part of my brain that (over)thinks about things like technique, structure, and the mechanics of how the music is being made, and transports me entirely to some other reality that's more experienced than thought.  - Chris Corsano.

McPhee / Brötzmann / Kessler / Zerang,The Damage is Done,"""The lines remain remarkably distinguishable even when they converge into such a large sound that it could be mistaken for cacophonic chaos."" - Lyn Horton",Catalytic Sound,https://joemcphee.bandcamp.com/album/the-damage-is-done,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/mcphee-brotzmann-kessler-zerang-the-damage-is-done/s-jLuRSqRkcrx
Henneman String Quartet,Piazza Pia,"""Described -- usually by classical music snobs -- as the superlative medium for a composer's thoughts in chamber music, the string quartet is often resistant to massive efforts to free it of ponderous 19th century memories and shove it into the modern era."" - JazzWeek",Catalytic Sound,https://abbaarsighennemanwig.bandcamp.com/album/piazza-pia,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/henneman-string-quartet-piazza-pia/s-HwWWzSbCjh4
Rodrigo Amado / Joe McPhee / Kent Kessler / Chris Corsano ,This Is Our Language ,"""Lisbon’s Rodrigo Amado has chosen a crack team of improvisers with whom to present his vocabulary. With This Is Our Language, he has succeeded in uniting the varied parlances of creative musicians around the world. Over the span of forty-three minutes, Amado has condensed a diverse array of concepts that blossom and mature with each listening. This is a commanding and authoritative recording that should not be missed."" - Peter Gough, Free Jazz Blog.

Joe Morris,Solos Bimhuis,"“Anthony Braxton’s For Alto surely had a huge hand in making improvisers feel it was necessary to explore and document solo material. Not  everyone who pursues that work is as successful as Braxton when doing so. Joe Morris is one of the most astounding solo music performers I’ve ever heard, and I believe this recording reaches the bar set so high by Braxton’s classic.” - Ken Vandermark.

Elisabeth Harnik,Ways of My Hands,"""The fractured, rhythmical and melodic elements of this suite may flow in an erratic, eccentric ways but do gravitate into delicate, arresting structures with their own, inner logic and fascinating architecture, expressing a myriad of sounds, feelings and textures, from soft and gentle to the rough and dense ones. A true, masterful work of art."" –Free Jazz Blog.

Brandon Lopez,quoniam facta sum vilis,"""In the first four tracks there are moments of respite and beauty amidst the chaos. After Pa, the sounds are harsher and it is a violent new landscape. There is a sense throughout the second half of desperately trying to get somewhere but being unable to do so. By transforming into this brutality, the album lives up to its name."" - Anna Heflin",Catalytic Sound,https://brandonlopez.bandcamp.com/album/quoniam-facta-sum-vilis,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/quoniam-facta-sum-vilis/s-TQjRgZoXTh6
Lytton / Vandermark / Wachsmann,CINC,"“This is a live recording from Slovenia of two of the major figures from the British school of improvisers (percussionist Paul Lytton and violinist Phillip Wachsmann) in a trio setting with Chicago reedist and composer Ken Vandermark. Lytton is a personal hero of mine, and I have only recently started digging more and more into Wacshmann’s remarkable discography. What is striking to me about this trio is the way that Vandermark negotiates his role in the ensemble. It’s as if he jumped into the deep end of the pool, unafraid, and without a life jacket on. He learns to swim among the giants rather quickly. This is remarkable music made by an all too short lived trio.” - Tim Daisy",Tim Daisy,https://vandermark1.bandcamp.com/album/cinc,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/lytton-vandermark-wachsmann/s-h15tyWlhZL1

Jeb Bishop / Tim Daisy,Old Shoulders ,"""Daisy and Bishop eschew the groove-oriented nature of some of their larger groups, namely The Engines and Vandermark 5. Old Shoulders is heavy on smart and playful extended investigations of textures and tones, of atmosphere and mood more than rhythm, aggression or melody."" - Patrick Wall, Free Times.
