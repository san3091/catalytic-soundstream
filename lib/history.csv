The Ex,Starters Alternators,"""The Ex have remained Amsterdam's best kept secret for a decade, despite a plethora of LPs, all with great lyrics... like its predecessors, it's a throat-grabbing, post-punk smacker that also lets in the more hushed, unsettling underbelly of the genre. Whether the band is more restrained, or full-throttle, these Dutchmen remain wired, compelling, and thoughtfully raw... Starters Alternators is a powerful earful of insurgency.""",Catalytic Sound,https://terriehesselsterprecords.bandcamp.com/album/starters-alternators?label=1651542186&tab=music,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/the-ex-starters-alternators/s-iy0UqWobf71
