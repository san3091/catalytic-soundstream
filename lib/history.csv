The Thing,Live at Blå,"""There are all the violent shrieks and wails one expects from Gustafsson, the polyrhythmic, Paul Lovens-ian drumming of Paal Nilssen-Love and Flaten's updated Mingus style. But there also are enough quiet, almost introspective moments that highlight each musician's technical facility and make the louder portions even more forceful."" -Andrey Henkin, All About Jazz",Catalytic Sound,https://gustafsson1.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-bl,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/live-at-bla/s-jwbylptw78N

The Vandermark 5,Beat Reader,"“An infectious sonic tapestry that weaves together elements of aleatoric pointillism, blistering free jazz, simmering blues, swaggering funk and searing rock, Vandermark's populist appeal rests in his ability to integrate the disparate strains of contemporary music's sundry counter-cultures into an organic whole.” -Troy Collins, All About Jazz.

"Jaap Blonk, Fred Lonberg-Holm & Michael Zerang",First Meetings,"""Cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm and percussionist Michael Zerang have collaboratively joined forces before, but the addition of Dutch vocalist Jaap Blonk is a wonderful complement to the Chicago duo. Blonk, of course, is much more than your usual ""singer, "" as the sounds he caresses from his vocal chords are utterly unconventional and strikingly unique. He is literally a one-man band, reaching into a bag of bizarre blips and pops, wonderfully complementing his colleagues. Lonberg-Holm and Zerang have mastered their crafts so well that they almost sound as one. Transforming the cello into a wildly, freestyle machine, Lonberg-Holm creates a unique blend of noise and scratches into which Zerang holds on and digs. The results are totally satisfying, and each of the ten tracks glows with highlights."" ~ Steven A.
