Andy Moor ,Marker,"""On this, his debut solo CD, Andy Moor explores a wide spectrum of his unusual guitar style, resulting in an exciting, varied and challenging collection, ranging from melodic solo guitar pieces to atmospheric soundscapes and wild outbursts of radical sound."" -Unsounds",Catalytic Sound,https://andymoorunsounds.bandcamp.com/album/marker,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/andy-moor-marker/s-3XgRCqaTTFb
Mats Gustafsson & Paul Lovens,Nothing to Read,"""This is a masterpiece of free improvisation, but good luck finding a copy. It confirms Mats's status as a master musician even at this relatively early stage of his career.""",Catalytic Sound,https://gustafsson1.bandcamp.com/album/mats-gustafsson-paul-lovens-nothing-to-read,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/mats-gustafsson-paul-lovens-nothing-to-read
Chris Corsano ,The Young Cricketer ,"""The Young Cricketer plays out like a showreel for Corsano’s miraculous dexterity and virtuosity as a drummer. It’s a set of recordings made during Corsano’s time living in Manchester back in 2006 utilising all manner of objects and apparatus to offset and treat his drumkit, often morphing its sound into something unrecognisable. The Young Cricketer is a beautifully recorded album, with Corsano’s expanded kit occupying a vast stereo field, and every percussive gesture allotted its own distinct place in the mix. Consequently, this is probably the most thorough representation of Corsano’s near peerless drumming yet committed to record and stands as a pretty indispensable document for all lovers of free music and percussive invention. Stunning.” - Julien Héraud.

Ig Henneman Kwintet,In Grassetto,"""… Her compositions inspire performances which are anything but ordinary, the collective improvising often breathtaking. The balance between melody and abstraction, rhythmic drive and ballad tones, keep it all sounding brilliantly right. In Grassetto feautures exciting bass clarinet Hein Pijnenburg, with Bart van der Putten's alto, Wilbert de Joode's bass, and Fred van Duynhoven's drums. They execute Henneman's turns magnificently. The leader has an original touch on viola."" --Doug Lang CODA Magazine 1999",Catalytic Sound,https://abbaarsighennemanwig.bandcamp.com/album/in-grassetto,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/ig-henneman-kwintet-in-grassetto/s-DiG0a4UIPXV
Wooley / Rempis / Niggenkemper / Corsano,From Wolves to Whales,"“The musicians delve deep into the outside schema of jazz amid a largely aggressive mode of attack. With hustling cadences, energized soloing and all the customary trimmings, the band acutely morphs the improv platform with semi-structured song-forms” - Glenn Astarita, All About Jazz",Catalytic Sound,https://daverempisaerophonicrecords.bandcamp.com/album/from-wolves-to-whales,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/wooley-rempis-niggenkemper-corsano-from-wolves-to-whales/s-WtNgwWagRvZ
Jaap Blonk's Splinks,Splinks,"""Debut record of the band that was a vehicle for my jazz compositions
from 1984 till 1999""",Catalytic Sound,https://jaapblonkkontrans.bandcamp.com/album/splinks-2,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/jaap-blonks-splinks-splinks-2/s-A0KFUxWbHOa
Joe McPhee & Paal Nilssen-Love,Tomorrow Came Today,"""There is great respect and mutual encouragement, as already testified by the first track, on which McPhee blows a very mournful slow tune, which incites Nilssen-Love to accentuate with little cymbal sounds, or the opposite, double the tempo for some high energy playing without creating a conflict. The second track starts with high energy drumming, inviting McPhee for improvising with the same intensity, and he does that by playing highly rhythmic bursts of sounds circling around the same tonal center, meeting the drums halfway, almost letting go of the sax as a lyrical instrument. On ""Ibsen's Ghost"", McPhee switches to pocket trumpet, first riding the intense percussive waves that the drummer creates, then slowing down to bird-like (or is it ghost-like?) fluttering, while Nilssen-Love switches to brushes in reaction. ""Acts Of Time"" brings the most controlled demonstration of the saxophonist's incredible skill, blowing high sustained overtone sounds, barely touching upon the silence at first, then increasing the intensity for some heart-piercing wailing, supported by thundering drumming. And the treat goes on and on. It must also be noted that the quality of the recording is excellent too, creating a very intimate feeling, as if both artists were playing next to you. Free, creative, open and disciplined : I love it."" -Free Jazz Blog",Catalytic Sound,https://paalnilssen-love.bandcamp.com/album/tomorrow-came-today,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/joe-mcphee-paal-nilssen-love-tomorrow-came-today/s-D2OajwcIxMy

Atomic / School Days,Distil,"""This is wonderful fun to hear. This is not boundary-shifting music, nor does it aspire to great artistic achievements. But it's a great performance by a band (or is it two bands?) that really starts benefiting from playing a lot together. I would love to see this band perform live.""  -Stef, Free Jazz Blog",Catalytic Sound,https://vandermark1.bandcamp.com/album/distil,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/atomic-school-days-distil/s-YE0xVXEKH5L
