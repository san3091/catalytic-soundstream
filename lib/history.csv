Entr'acte,Soigne Ta Droite,“There is nothing that I love more than composing for and working with a large ensemble. Entr’acte is the most recent iteration of a process for me that’s developed over more than two decades. The band is comprised of an international cast of 10 musical characters who I believe represent the highest levels of the improviser’s art.” - Ken Vandermark,Ken Vandermark,https://vandermark1.bandcamp.com/album/soigne-ta-droite?label=1651542186&tab=music,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/entracte-soigne-ta-droite/s-0GjYEBAm60a

Joe Morris Quartet,Underthru,"""it is the most overtly jazz-based recording in the Morris catalog... Underthru swings and grooves and leaves a lot of space for interaction."" -Larry Appelbaum, JazzTimes",Catalytic Sound,https://joemorrisritiglacialeratic.bandcamp.com/album/underthru,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/underthru/s-UTPXEBJJ5P6
Ex Orkest,Een Rondje Holland,"""Rather than simply grafting cheesy strings to original songs, these Dutch noiseniks have bent a 20-piece orchestra to their own polyrhythmic, cacophonous needs. The result is pure sonic excess. Latinate brass fanfares slur, goaded by jagged slashing from cellos as the five members of The Ex raise a tumult. The music is a delirious pummeling, all energy and rhythm on cuts like ""Kokend Asfalt"" (which is a reworked ""State of Shock"" from ""Scrabbling at the Lock"" with cellist Tom Cora) or the Stravinsky-meets-Stooges ""Meer Nieuws"" (which alters ""River,"" from ""Dizzy Spells"")."" -Kevin Williams, Chicago Tribune",Catalytic Sound,https://terriehesselsterprecords.bandcamp.com/album/een-rondje-holland,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/een-rondje-holland/s-FLel2uc8fZx

Jaap Blonk / Machinefabriek,Deep Fried,"""Now this a strange one. I never would've thought I would be paired with Jaap Blonk... it seems an unlikely combination. But when Tijs van Trigt asked us to perform at his AMPsnacks event in Arnhem, we had such a blast that we decided to do some recording together. This cd is a selection of three hours of improvisation we recorded at STEIM in Amsterdam. Quite a rollercoaster I'd say!"" - Rutger Zuydervelt.

"Anders Jormin, Christian Jormin & Mats Gustafsson",Opus Apus,"""This rare meeting has developed into this exciting CD ”Opus apus”. The title refers to that the

Elisabeth Harnik & Frank Gratkowski,Burrum​​-​​bah,"""Their interplay is so nuanced and quite often you may wonder where one idea began or finished as so much fascinating musical, intellectual, and emotional information is being exchanged at every given moment."" - Eyal Hareuveni",Catalytic Sound,https://elisabethharnik.bandcamp.com/album/burrum-bah,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/burrum-bah/s-tw8QbCsAZSQ
