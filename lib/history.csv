Ab Baars,A Free Step: The Music of John Carter,"“Baars is clearly pursuing his own voice through this demanding, rewarding material; in this regard, his outings on tenor provide a necessary contrast. His colleagues are well-suited for the project: Wilbert de Joode is a powerful bass player, whose work is often strongly felt before the notes are fully articulated in the mind; and Martin van Duynhoven is a solid ensemble player who pushes the music with shrewd cross rhythms. They are a trio that does justice to the music of John Carter."" –Bill Shoemaker, Jazz Times. Clarinet, Tenor Saxophone – Ab Baars. Double Bass – Wilbert de Joode. Drums – Martin van Duynhoven. 1998.",Catalytic Sound,https://abbaarsighennemanwig.bandcamp.com/album/a-free-step-the-music-of-john-carter,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/ab-baars-trio-a-free-step-the-music-of-john-carter/s-cgilVOOPQ1d

AALY Trio + Ken Vandermark,Hidden In The Stomach,"“The playing is often turbulent and roiling, but never wanders so far afield as to become divorced from the structure of the compositions, which tends to be blues based or even noir-ish.” -Brian Olewnick, AllMusic.

Ab Baars Trio,Sprok,"“This was the first record that I heard of Ab Baars’ music. From moment one I was hooked and still am.

Mats Gustafsson,Mouth Eating Trees,"“I heard a cassette of this album in gallery and record label director John Corbett’s car while driving along Lake Shore Drive about 25 years ago.

Paal Nilssen-Love,"The Quintet (July 8th, 1998)","“A recording which provides an exciting glimpse into Paal’s musical roots. In addition, it represents a historic transfer between a generation of musicians who came up with and played alongside Jan Garbarek and Arild Andersen, to those who would carry the Norwegian scene into the 21st century.” - Ken Vandermark.

Trumpets and Drums,Live In Ljubljana,"“Nate Wooley has had an ongoing duo project with the legendary English drummer and improviser, Paul Lytton, for more than a dozen years, and has been collaborating with fellow trumpeter, Peter Evans, for just as long.

Joe Morris,Sweatshop,"“I used to hear this band all the time growing up in the Boston area as a teenager.  It was an incredible counterpart to the Joe Morris Trio (with the same lineup though playing a completely different book of tunes), and combined elements of Band of Gypsys and Prime Time but- as always- Joe’s musical vision was completely his own.” - Ken Vandermark.
