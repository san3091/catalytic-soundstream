Ballister,Slag,"""SLAG is a triumphant recording on many levels. It can exhaust you with its energy jazz or lull you into submission with its minutiae.

Dave Rempis / Lasse Marhaug,Naancore,“The impact that saxophonist Dave Rempis has had on the contemporary improvised music scene extends way beyond Chicago.

The Rempis Percussion Quartet,Sud Des Alpes,"This record is the tenth release by The Rempis Percussion Quartet, recorded during a 2019 European tour that celebrated their fifteenth anniversary as a working ensemble. Those are some pretty hefty milestones. So how do they push forward artistically with so much already under their belt? From what we hear on Sud Des Alpes, it’s all about digging deeper into the musical dilemmas they’ve been examining for years. These four improvisers continue to grind ideas and perspectives against one another, yielding an ever more refined version of their shared vision. This is patient work, done over a long period. In the rapidly shifting social media era, one whose gaze flickers back and forth like a cornered rat as it scans for the next big thing, this may seem archaic.

"Peter Evans, Agustí Fernández & Mats Gustafsson",Kopros Lithos,"""As an archeological project, this recording is a rare artifact, documenting the collaboration of three important improvisers whose technique is paraded on each track. Sometimes they choose to walk a minimalist line, Fernández exploring the piano's insides—much of the time mimicking a percussionist—while Gustafsson and Evans play with breathy sounds. In other spots, Gustafsson delivers his now-patented shout-smack saxophone punch and Evans brings his growling rumbles. Without the persistence of beat or the bounds of meter, the trio is free to exercise some serious kopros noise-making, Some may think these challenging sounds merde, others an instant archaeological treasure."" –All About Jazz",Catalytic Sound,https://gustafsson1.bandcamp.com/album/kopros-lithos,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/kopros-lithos/s-S4tW85xrevT

Terrie Hessels & Ab Baars,Hef,"""In English there's a related idiom: Dutch courage. That's when intoxication makes you fearless. Perhaps a fitting image for Ab Baars and Terrie Ex on their first record of duets, ""Hef"". I'm not referring to literal drunkenness, of course, but a figurative image of being tanked, a thoroughly internalized sense of dizzy, giddy musical interaction, bravery to try things you'd know you wouldn't/ shouldn't when sober. Ab is creative music's official drunken master (past masters: Ben Webster, Archie Shepp), and the marvelous Mr. Ex is a very worthy drunkboxing partner. In Ab's tenor especially, I hear this approach (keep in mind, Chan only turns to drunken boxing when pushed to do so!) - a loopy, wild, off-kilter phraseology that's precise and imprecise in the right balance, or rather in the right relation. In the twosome's opener, ""Oud Over"", Ab lurches and sways like a sot. But beware, 'cause just when you think he'll topple over, he turns into a bloodthirsty silver machine, attacking the jugular and slicing in tandem with Terrie's electric chicken-scratch scrapple of strings. Listen on ""Stokdutter"" as the guitarist's metallic shards combust behind Baars' slow-motion clarinet, unfazed by sudden motion - two temporalities superimposed, the unreality of unitary chronological time for a buzzed man. The drunken master works at his own pace. What's it take to make music like ""Hef""? A liter and a half of Dutch courage."" –John Corbett, Chicago, January 2000",Catalytic Sound,https://terriehesselsterprecords.bandcamp.com/album/hef,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/hef/s-f04vFqFjqW1
Christof Kurzmann & Ken Vandermark,Consequent Duos: series 2e,"“Consequent Duos: series 2e//Christof Kurzmann & Ken Vandermark” (AGR/SvA-017) indicates a stunning musical interplay that’s been developed through years of concerts together. Though this sonic dialog is informed by their mutual performance history, there is no attempt to replicate their collaborative work in other bands. Often the music documented here doesn’t even sound as though it’s been created by a duo. Frequently it has the impact of a wide ranging series of concertos- with Vandermark’s contributions falling literally in the center of Kurzmann’s improvised and layered “orchestrations.”",Catalytic Sound,https://vandermark1.bandcamp.com/album/consequent-duos-series-2e,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/consequent-duos-series-2e/s-UkSp7cRBzWW
Perch Hen Brock & Rain,Live @ Jazz Happening,"(...) This intersection of the newer Dutch swing and post- Downtown New York sound evidences a newly refreshed improvised music. Not free jazz, nor exactly free improvisation, the five pieces make mannerly and urbane connections. It's difficult to define a leader for this quartet, maybe because so much is shared. ""Brock"" opens with Laubrock and Baars trading saxophone notes from the upper and lower registers until Rainey pushes the ""go"" button with his drumming. After a pause at the midway point, Henneman's viola signals a slower tempo and an abandonment of all aggression. She opens ""Rain"" with a high-wire performance that calls for the dancing sticks of Rainey, Baars' clarinet, and the bird-like calls of Laubrock's soprano saxophone. The music develops as a piece of chamber music albeit never abandoning the heated flames of improvisation. Baars' shakuhachi playing is mystical on ""Tampere"" and ""Hen,"" both pieces that gather momentum as improvised music, but coalesce as seemingly composed music. Such prestidigitation is evidence of music making at the highest levels."" –Mark Corroto **** allaboutjazz.com",Catalytic Sound,https://abbaarsighennemanwig.bandcamp.com/album/live-the-jazz-happening,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/live-jazz-happening/s-TQ76IQ8KbiW

Henneman Strijkkwartet,Pes,"""The string quartet is an instrumental combination most often heard in many different genres of classical music; in fact, it is one of the standard groupings for this music, whereas it is a more rare enterprise in improvised music. Certainly there are examples of string players getting together to improvise, but the results can not so often be compared favorably with great classical string quartets. The Dutch viola player and composer Henneman is making great progress in this area however, as she has found a regular group of musicians to work with, evidenced by the six-year span of recording dates. The difficult task of integrating composition and improvisation is carried out with aplomb by this group: they actually make it sound easy. A nice combination of male and female energy exists in this group, as well as a combination of Dutch musicians and so-called ex-patriot Americans who have settled in the Netherlands. The players are comfortable working in a traditional, melodic, and harmonic manner but also can and do go way out. Everything that happens makes logical sense, and this is music that reveals rich layers of detail upon repeated listenings."" - Eugene Chadbourne (All Music)",Catalytic Sound,https://abbaarsighennemanwig.bandcamp.com/album/pes,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/pes/s-3Os70kM6UHr

Ab Baars,A Free Step: The Music of John Carter,"“Baars is clearly pursuing his own voice through this demanding, rewarding material; in this regard, his outings on tenor provide a necessary contrast. His colleagues are well-suited for the project: Wilbert de Joode is a powerful bass player, whose work is often strongly felt before the notes are fully articulated in the mind; and Martin van Duynhoven is a solid ensemble player who pushes the music with shrewd cross rhythms. They are a trio that does justice to the music of John Carter."" –Bill Shoemaker, Jazz Times. Clarinet, Tenor Saxophone – Ab Baars. Double Bass – Wilbert de Joode.

Peter Brotzmann Chicago Tentet,Images,"""The 37-minute ""All Things Being Equal"" by Ken Vandermark takes up over half of the disc. It is segmented and indexed, a sop for those who hesitate to commit so much time to a single performance. But it rewards persistent attention by contrasting tightly organized full-ensemble episodes like the opening segment, with its spirited McPhee trumpet solo, with arranged showcases for single soloists and some collectively improvised reed-tangle.""",Catalytic Sound,https://vandermark1.bandcamp.com/album/images,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/images/s-T4vJrdBtcSl

Sylvie Courvoisier / Mary Halvorson,Crop Circles,"""This debut recording between two of New York’s most idiosyncratic and distinctive improvisers reveals just what careful listeners pianist Sylvie Courvoisier and guitarist Mary Halvorson really are. Each musician contributed pieces to the album, which is deeply chamber-like in its deft, interactive intimacy. But the real action is where they take those written themes."" -Peter Margasak.
