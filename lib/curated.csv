Jaap Blonk / Bart van der Putten / Paul Pallesen,Off Shore ,"""A trio set of thoughtful and concentrated music. In each composition Jaap Blonk used a different scale for rising than for descending intervals. This leads to improvisations with very little redundancy. Bart van der Putten plays both clarinet and alto saxophone here, while Paul Pallesen can be heard on electric guitar as well as banjo.

Chris Corsano ,The Young Cricketer ,"""The Young Cricketer plays out like a showreel for Corsano’s miraculous dexterity and virtuosity as a drummer. It’s a set of recordings made during Corsano’s time living in Manchester back in 2006 utilising all manner of objects and apparatus to offset and treat his drumkit, often morphing its sound into something unrecognisable. The Young Cricketer is a beautifully recorded album, with Corsano’s expanded kit occupying a vast stereo field, and every percussive gesture allotted its own distinct place in the mix. Consequently, this is probably the most thorough representation of Corsano’s near peerless drumming yet committed to record and stands as a pretty indispensable document for all lovers of free music and percussive invention.

Joe Morris / Agustí Fernández / Nate Wooley,From The Discrete To The Particular ,"""Being perfectly aware that a trio featuring Joe Morris on guitar, Agustí Fernández on piano and Nate Wooley on trumpet can’t be, for an immanent reason connected to the mastery of the musicians, less than rewarding, my attention has instead been caught by the title of the album. Echoing and mixing several philosophical and scientific subjects it is, in my opinion, a brief and inspired description of some tendencies and paths sketched out in the compositions."" - Paolo Casertano, Free Jazz Blog.

Lytton / Vandermark / Wachsmann,CINC,"“This is a live recording from Slovenia of two of the major figures from the British school of improvisers (percussionist Paul Lytton and violinist Phillip Wachsmann) in a trio setting with Chicago reedist and composer Ken Vandermark. Lytton is a personal hero of mine, and I have only recently started digging more and more into Wacshmann’s remarkable discography. What is striking to me about this trio is the way that Vandermark negotiates his role in the ensemble. It’s as if he jumped into the deep end of the pool, unafraid, and without a life jacket on. He learns to swim among the giants rather quickly. This is remarkable music made by an all too short lived trio.” - Tim Daisy",Tim Daisy,https://vandermark1.bandcamp.com/album/cinc,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/lytton-vandermark-wachsmann/s-h15tyWlhZL1

But when Tijs van Trigt asked us to perform at his AMPsnacks event in Arnhem, we had such a blast that we decided to do some recording together.

Mats Gustafsson / Barry Guy / Paul Lovens,Mouth Eating Trees and Related Activities,"""Swedish multi-reed artist Mats Gustafsson was just beginning to come into his own at the time of this recording. The oddly titled Mouth Eating Trees and Related Activities catches him at the cusp when his prodigious technical abilities were starting to be subsumed into an impressive musical presence. It doesn't hurt that his companions for this freely improvised session are stalwarts like Barry Guy and Paul Lovens, who provide accompaniment that's creatively telepathic. While Gustafsson's sound is distinct, particularly his use of breathy and vocal sounds, there are still moments when he hurtles into his own sonic investigations with seemingly little regard to his fellow musicians."" - Brian Olewnick.

Jaap Blonk,Polyphtong ,"""Polyphtong is a purely vocal piece with no electronically generated sounds. It was conceived as a quadraphonic piece for live performance. It was premiered at Stanford University in March of 2012, and solely based on live voice sounds fed into a MaxMSP patch. The origin of the title is: an extension of ‘diphtong’. In the summer of 2013 I radically reworked the piece to create the stereo version presented on this CD. All sounds heard in it are based on my vocal and other mouth sounds. In some cases attacks were changed, which make the sounds less recognizable as vocal. Algorithmic composition was used to create the layering of sounds."" - Jaap Blonk.

Dave Rempis / Joshua Abrams / Avreeayl Ra,Aphelion,"""This debut release by the regular working trio of Dave Rempis, Joshua Abrams, and Avreeayl Ra is a perfect example of what makes Chicago such a fertile breeding ground for improvised music; three musicians of widely varying ages, backgrounds, playing experiences, and musical interests join forces to deliver moments of both sublime beauty and volcanic energy, continually tempered by the seamless narrative momentum that they weave together in a seemingly effortless way. Although the trio has only been working since the fall of 2012, their group dynamic reveals a chemistry that feels much more seasoned than such a short time might allow – perhaps a result of their shared interest in musical experiences that transcend the every day level, and offer something more substantial to the listener. With Abrams doubling on several different string instruments, and Ra on his characteristically wide array of percussion, the music these three create together is wide-ranging in nature, drawing upon influences from around the world to create a sound that’s totally unique within the current milieu of improvised music."" - Unknown.

Wheelhouse,Boss Of The Plaines ,"""The Rempis Percussion Quartet is a free-improvising whirlwind that draws inspiration from a shared interest in West African and Latin American rhythms, coupled with American funk and free jazz. Using these influences, the band creates spontaneous music which nevertheless maintains a focus on ensemble motion and compositional structures. Led by saxophonist Dave Rempis (The Engines, Ballister, Triage, Vandermark Five) the band originally formed for a house party in April 2004, and their performances maintain an unabashedly raucous energy based on relentless grooves and unrestrained blowing, tempered with occasional moments of quiet balladry. This quartet has toured regularly in both the US and Europe, with North American tours in 2006 and 2007, and European tours in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012 including several major European festival performances. The band has also released five records, including the limited edition “Circular Logic” (Utech Records 2005) “Rip Tear Crunch” (482 Music 2006) “Hunter-Gatherers” (482 Music – 2007), “The Disappointment of Parsley (Not Two – 2009), and Montreal Parade (482 Music – 2011). Phalanx, a two-cd set of live concert recordings from 2012, finds them in top form, barnstorming cities on two continents with their propulsive improvisations. This is the second recording of the band featuring its newest member, Norwegian phenom Ingebrigt Håker Flaten, and these two hard-charging sets show a band at the peak of its creative force."" - Aerophonic Records.

Lean Left,Live at Cafe Oto,"""Lean Left throws together two explosive duos - the sax/drums collision course of Ken Vandermark and Paal Nilsson-Love with the piledriving guitarists from The Ex - to make up a positively apocalyptic quartet: an elemental musical force featuring Grade A international players zoning in and scrambling together rock, jazz, noise and blistering free improv into a highly-charged onstage assault, each member taking their sounds and bodies to the edge and often snapping out of the wilds and into glorious passages of regular rhythm. Recorded live at Café Oto, London in 2011. The music of Lean Left is extrovert, energetic, powerful and inclusive but also confrontational and provocative: where rhythm, noise, melody and harmony melt together in perfect union. In two tracks “Live at Café Oto” captures one moment of high powered, highly varied improvisation. Pretty much the dream ticket for those who like their live music raw, hard and violently soulful."" - Unsounds.
