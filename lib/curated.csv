Ken Vandermark,Caffeine,"""Caffeine is an energy trio capable of expressing both the powerful and the delicate sides of scoreless improvisation. At its heart is drummer Steve Hunt (a veteran of Hal Russell’s NRG Ensemble), who, like his nearest correlate Tony Oxley, is a master of the lightly controlled percussive phrase as well as the all-out jam. Ken Vandermark, swapping between saxes, clarinet and bass clarinet, holds the threads together with humorous, jutting lines that complement, seldom obscure the band’s harmonic transitions. The astounding playing of Jim Baker comes as a revelation to me. His hands move with blinding speed across the registers, pushing chordal chunks around as if they were puzzle pieces."" - Scott Hacker, Cadence Magazine.

Chris Corsano ,The Young Cricketer ,"""The Young Cricketer plays out like a showreel for Corsano’s miraculous dexterity and virtuosity as a drummer. It’s a set of recordings made during Corsano’s time living in Manchester back in 2006 utilising all manner of objects and apparatus to offset and treat his drumkit, often morphing its sound into something unrecognisable. The Young Cricketer is a beautifully recorded album, with Corsano’s expanded kit occupying a vast stereo field, and every percussive gesture allotted its own distinct place in the mix. Consequently, this is probably the most thorough representation of Corsano’s near peerless drumming yet committed to record and stands as a pretty indispensable document for all lovers of free music and percussive invention.

Lytton / Vandermark / Wachsmann,CINC,"“This is a live recording from Slovenia of two of the major figures from the British school of improvisers (percussionist Paul Lytton and violinist Phillip Wachsmann) in a trio setting with Chicago reedist and composer Ken Vandermark. Lytton is a personal hero of mine, and I have only recently started digging more and more into Wacshmann’s remarkable discography. What is striking to me about this trio is the way that Vandermark negotiates his role in the ensemble. It’s as if he jumped into the deep end of the pool, unafraid, and without a life jacket on.

The oddly titled Mouth Eating Trees and Related Activities catches him at the cusp when his prodigious technical abilities were starting to be subsumed into an impressive musical presence. It doesn't hurt that his companions for this freely improvised session are stalwarts like Barry Guy and Paul Lovens, who provide accompaniment that's creatively telepathic.

Jaap Blonk,Polyphtong ,"""Polyphtong is a purely vocal piece with no electronically generated sounds. It was conceived as a quadraphonic piece for live performance. It was premiered at Stanford University in March of 2012, and solely based on live voice sounds fed into a MaxMSP patch. The origin of the title is: an extension of ‘diphtong’. In the summer of 2013 I radically reworked the piece to create the stereo version presented on this CD. All sounds heard in it are based on my vocal and other mouth sounds. In some cases attacks were changed, which make the sounds less recognizable as vocal. Algorithmic composition was used to create the layering of sounds."" - Jaap Blonk.

Dave Rempis / Joshua Abrams / Avreeayl Ra,Aphelion,"""This debut release by the regular working trio of Dave Rempis, Joshua Abrams, and Avreeayl Ra is a perfect example of what makes Chicago such a fertile breeding ground for improvised music; three musicians of widely varying ages, backgrounds, playing experiences, and musical interests join forces to deliver moments of both sublime beauty and volcanic energy, continually tempered by the seamless narrative momentum that they weave together in a seemingly effortless way. Although the trio has only been working since the fall of 2012, their group dynamic reveals a chemistry that feels much more seasoned than such a short time might allow – perhaps a result of their shared interest in musical experiences that transcend the every day level, and offer something more substantial to the listener. With Abrams doubling on several different string instruments, and Ra on his characteristically wide array of percussion, the music these three create together is wide-ranging in nature, drawing upon influences from around the world to create a sound that’s totally unique within the current milieu of improvised music."" - Unknown.

Wheelhouse,Boss Of The Plaines ,"""The Rempis Percussion Quartet is a free-improvising whirlwind that draws inspiration from a shared interest in West African and Latin American rhythms, coupled with American funk and free jazz. Using these influences, the band creates spontaneous music which nevertheless maintains a focus on ensemble motion and compositional structures. Led by saxophonist Dave Rempis (The Engines, Ballister, Triage, Vandermark Five) the band originally formed for a house party in April 2004, and their performances maintain an unabashedly raucous energy based on relentless grooves and unrestrained blowing, tempered with occasional moments of quiet balladry. This quartet has toured regularly in both the US and Europe, with North American tours in 2006 and 2007, and European tours in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012 including several major European festival performances. The band has also released five records, including the limited edition “Circular Logic” (Utech Records 2005) “Rip Tear Crunch” (482 Music 2006) “Hunter-Gatherers” (482 Music – 2007), “The Disappointment of Parsley (Not Two – 2009), and Montreal Parade (482 Music – 2011).

Recorded live at Café Oto, London in 2011. The music of Lean Left is extrovert, energetic, powerful and inclusive but also confrontational and provocative: where rhythm, noise, melody and harmony melt together in perfect union. In two tracks “Live at Café Oto” captures one moment of high powered, highly varied improvisation.

Both halves contain breadth and depth well beyond the simplicity of a duo. Anker and Lonberg-Holm’s duet plays on all their strengths. Their extended improvisation takes a kind of narrative approach with the titling, “Ice King” / “Melt” / “The Frigid Air” / “Cold Only Hurts Those Who Feel,” and the playing is thrillingly free. Anker and Lonberg-Holm both have a way of taking tuneful lines to their scorched edges, successfully mixing atonal leaps with extended techniques."" - Lee Rice Epstein, Free Jazz Blog.

"Ig Henneman, Jaimie Branch, Anne La Berge",Dropping Stuff and Other Folk Songs,"One of the (many) things that's so awesome about this trio is the way that each of the three players manage to be true to their own highly-developed personal language while simultaneously melding that language into the group's collective-sound.  - Chris Corsano.

Rempis / Johnston / Ochs,Spectral,"""This free-improvising trio came together in the fall of 2011, when Rempis journeyed to the West Coast to discover some things about his compatriots on the Bay Area improving scene. Trumpeter Johnston, a frequent visitor to Chicago, where the two had collaborated in several different settings in the years prior, suggested this trio lineup for a performance at Oakland’s Uptown Nightclub. Although Rempis hadn’t worked with Ochs before, the latter’s renowned experience in the all-horn lineup of ROVA made the idea especially appealing. From the first few notes, that initial meeting flowed comfortably, yet in totally unexpected ways, with all three making logical structural decisions that gave their improvisations the feel of through-composed pieces. Eager to continue developing this language that the three later came to dub “invisible architecture,” Rempis made a follow-up trip to the Bay Area in the spring of 2012 for two more concerts and a studio recording session. Spectral, the first document of their work, was the result of that visit, and shows an improvising trio playing out an audible game of chess. Not satisfied with simply existing in the moment, these three combine sensibilities to look many moves ahead, setting each other up time and again to capitalize on structural possibilities that give rare and meaningful form to an otherwise very spontaneous music. - ""Aerophonic Records"".

Tashi Dorji & Tyler Damon,Both Will Escape,"""Both Will Escape is the debut full-length between electric guitarist Tashi Dorji and percussionist Tyler Damon. In the long tradition of string/drum duets -- from Bailey & Bennink to Haino & Yoshida -- these two cleave out their own unmapped continent of sound. Across four pieces they connect lashes of ecstatic intensity and outer reaches of texture and timbre. At times Dorji's brutal electric torrents meld into Damon's metal and tonal abstractions. These two developed in parallel for years before forging an ongoing duo in 2015. Dorji has released a string of startling acoustic albums that've rescrambled six-string notions of jazz/improv/Flamenco. Damon's rethink of overtone and rhythm is enraptured as it's stupefying in solo exhibitions or with Mars Williams, Darin Gray and Thee Open Sex."" - Family Vineyard.

Rempis / Abrams / Ra / Baker,Perihelion,"""This sophomore release by the working trio of Dave Rempis, Joshua Abrams, and Avreeayl Ra shows a band doubling down on the slow, patient approach to improvising that characterized their first release, 2014’s Aphelion. The trio continues to pulsate, expanding ever outwards, yet returning to a central core each time to launch their next adventure. The live sets presented on this new two-disc set document that musical expansion and contraction within the trio, but also take things a step further as the band adds enigmatic keyboardist Jim Baker to the fold as a special guest for disc two. Baker’s a logical choice to meet up with these three; his own trio with Abrams and Ra, although a sporadic grouping, dates back to the early aught’s, and he’s worked with both in countless other contexts across many years. Similarly, a multitude of collaborations between he and Rempis date back to the late 1990’s. On Perihelion, these two overlapping circles spiral seamlessly into focus to demonstrate the gravitational strength of a central core built by decades of shared history."" - Aerophonic Records.

The Rempis / Daisy Duo,Second Spring,"""Dave Rempis and Tim Daisy are two musicians whose work has helped to define an entire generation of Chicago improvisers. Having performed together since they both hit the Chicago scene in the fall of 1997, these two have joined forces on hundreds of performances and dozens of recordings with notable groups including Triage, The Engines, The Rempis Percussion Quartet, The Vandermark Five, and countless other ad hoc groupings. Their duo pairing has a similarly long history whose roots date back to the countless all-day/all-night workshop sessions that Daisy hosted in his garage practice space in the late 90’s, where these two rolled up their sleeves together for the first time, laying the foundation for a lengthy and fruitful set of collaborations. On this recording, a follow-up to their 2005 release “Back To The Circle” on the Okkadisk imprint, the two capitalize on these deep roots to produce an almost telepathic interaction in their improvisations. Never willing to settle into comfortable territory though, the two continue to push each other into new sonic realms, repeatedly pulling the carpet out from one another as the ground becomes too firm under foot."" - Aerophonic Records.

Rempis / Johnston / Ochs ,Neutral Nation,"""This live recording finds the collaborative trio of Rempis, Johnston, and Ochs hard at work in the middle of their first full-on North American tour in May of 2015. Documenting a concert from the landmark venue Hallwalls in Buffalo, NY, the trio follows up on their previous release, 2014’s Spectral, having taken their unique approach to spontaneous composition to the next level through the crucible that only touring can provide. On this new recording they tackle two pieces that are significantly more extended than the ones documented on their earlier release, while still employing the same core strategy that made that recording so compelling; an ability to look far down the road in order to anticipate the larger structures that can emerge from even the slightest gesture. The trio moves with patience, and capitalizes on space, waiting for the appropriate moments to strike, always at the service of the ensemble motion."" - Aerophonic Records.
