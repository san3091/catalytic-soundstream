Henneman Strijkkwartet,Pes,"""The string quartet is an instrumental combination most often heard in many different genres of classical music; in fact, it is one of the standard groupings for this music, whereas it is a more rare enterprise in improvised music. Certainly there are examples of string players getting together to improvise, but the results can not so often be compared favorably with great classical string quartets. The Dutch viola player and composer Henneman is making great progress in this area however, as she has found a regular group of musicians to work with, evidenced by the six-year span of recording dates. The difficult task of integrating composition and improvisation is carried out with aplomb by this group: they actually make it sound easy. A nice combination of male and female energy exists in this group, as well as a combination of Dutch musicians and so-called ex-patriot Americans who have settled in the Netherlands. The players are comfortable working in a traditional, melodic, and harmonic manner but also can and do go way out. Everything that happens makes logical sense, and this is music that reveals rich layers of detail upon repeated listenings."" - Eugene Chadbourne (All Music)",Catalytic Sound,https://abbaarsighennemanwig.bandcamp.com/album/pes,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/pes/s-3Os70kM6UHr

Ab Baars,And She Speaks: A Collection of Ballads,"“Few things are as radical as Ab Baars' solo music. From the application of Von Freeman’s influence on tenor to the inspiration of John Carter on clarinet, Ab has created a unique voice in the history of improvised music, one that I continually seek out as a motivator for my own work.” - Ken Vandermark",Ken Vandermark,https://abbaarsighennemanwig.bandcamp.com/album/and-she-speaks-a-collection-of-ballads?label=1651542186&tab=music,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/ab-baars-and-she-speaks/s-ydEhTDd5dRT
Gustafsson / Nilssen-Love / Asmamaw,Baro 101,"“Baro 101 totally undermines the notion that improv is a stale, overly-intellectualised genre for Western, coffee-swilling virtuosos. It’s warm and it swings, engaging and challenging at once. This is, to me, what improv should be, and I would happily place Baro 101 alongside the seminal works of Peter Brotzmann, AMM and John Russell. Time will tell if this has quite the impact those guys did, but I certainly hope so.” - Joseph Burnett",Catalytic Sound,https://terriehesselsterprecords.bandcamp.com/album/baro-101?label=1651542186&tab=music,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/mats-gustafsson-paal-nilssen-love-masele-asmamaw-baro-101/s-JiGFhEEoiWO
Icepick,Hexane,"“This is one of my favorite trios, which is not surprising because it features three of my favorite musicians. In addition to Ingebrigt on bass, Icepick includes Chris Corsano on drums, and Nate Wooley on trumpet. The DKV Trio played on a double bill with them in Toronto a few years ago, and that was a gig for the ages!”  - Ken Vandermark",Ken Vandermark,https://ingebrigthkerflaten.bandcamp.com/album/hexane?label=1651542186&tab=music,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/icepick-hexane/s-x9JqeWIQewQ
New Monuments,New Earth,"""Sounds like someone stepped on a copy of Mahavishnu Orchestra's ""Birds of Fire"", put it on the turntable, loved what they heard, and pressed it into a CD. Pure spontaneous music from three of the heaviest in contemporary music.""",Catalytic Sound,https://natewooleypleasureofthetextsoundamerican.bandcamp.com/album/new-earth,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/new-monuments-new-earth/s-1BZxiDXDch0
The Ex,Starters Alternators,"""The Ex have remained Amsterdam's best kept secret for a decade, despite a plethora of LPs, all with great lyrics... like its predecessors, it's a throat-grabbing, post-punk smacker that also lets in the more hushed, unsettling underbelly of the genre. Whether the band is more restrained, or full-throttle, these Dutchmen remain wired, compelling, and thoughtfully raw... Starters Alternators is a powerful earful of insurgency.""",Catalytic Sound,https://terriehesselsterprecords.bandcamp.com/album/starters-alternators?label=1651542186&tab=music,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/the-ex-starters-alternators/s-iy0UqWobf71
Entr'acte,Soigne Ta Droite,“There is nothing that I love more than composing for and working with a large ensemble. Entr’acte is the most recent iteration of a process for me that’s developed over more than two decades. The band is comprised of an international cast of 10 musical characters who I believe represent the highest levels of the improviser’s art.” - Ken Vandermark,Ken Vandermark,https://vandermark1.bandcamp.com/album/soigne-ta-droite?label=1651542186&tab=music,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/entracte-soigne-ta-droite/s-0GjYEBAm60a

Joe Morris & Agustí Fernández,Ambrosia,"“Mixing conventional and extended techniques, melodies and harmonies, this duo creates a shifting landscape of sound. From swirling clouds that are dark and grainy, to ones that are fragmentary and fleeting, these improvisors use all of their respective instruments to elicit texture and song.” - Paul Acquaro, Free Jazz Blog",Catalytic Sound,https://joemorrisritiglacialeratic.bandcamp.com/album/ambrosia?label=1651542186&tab=music,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/joe-morris-agusti-fernandez-ambrosia/s-izkko7VqQ9L
Nate Wooley,Seven Storey Mountain V,"“Nate Wooley is one of the most significant musicians on the contemporary scene, creating and participating in essential projects across many genres: new music, improvised music, noise music…  Seven Storey Mountain is his ever evolving large ensemble, staggering in energy and accomplishment.”  - Ken Vandermark",Ken Vandermark,https://natewooleypleasureofthetextsoundamerican.bandcamp.com/album/seven-storey-mountain-v?label=1651542186&tab=music,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/seven-storey-mountain-part-v/s-sBl5Op9y2A6

Arashi,Jikan,"“Like Hairy Bones, another group that features a legendary, innovative reed player (this time, Akira Sakata), and driven by the creative force of Paal’s drumming. Thankfully, Arashi remains an ongoing concern- any chance to hear Akira Sakata fronting a rhythm section like this (with Johan Berthling on bass) is a cause for celebration.”  - Ken Vandermark",Ken Vandermark,https://paalnilssen-love.bandcamp.com/album/jikan-2,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/arashi-jikan/s-1ZnL6qjzXCp

Tim Daisy,A Forward Line :: Original Sounds 2004​​-​​2020,"“Tim Daisy has been a mainstay on the Chicago improvised music scene for nearly two decades, and his work as a drummer, composer, and bandleader has brought him international acclaim. For those less familiar with his music, the overview that A Forward Line provides is a perfect place to start; for those that already celebrate Tim’s contributions, this album is a reminder as to why.” - Ken Vandermark",Ken Vandermark,https://timdaisyrelayrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/tim-daisy-a-forward-line-original-sounds-2004-2020-relay-digital-011?label=1651542186&tab=music,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/tim-daisy-a-forward-line-original-sounds-2004-2020/s-vIuMkw4X8wL
