Wooley / Rempis / Niggenkemper / Corsano,From Wolves to Whales,"“The musicians delve deep into the outside schema of jazz amid a largely aggressive mode of attack.

Xavier Charles,12 Clarinets in a Fridge,"""This was a project a long time in the making - Xavier Charles is a not a person you can rush; he has very clear objectives that need the time that they take.

Dave Rempis / Lasse Marhaug,Naancore,“The impact that saxophonist Dave Rempis has had on the contemporary improvised music scene extends way beyond Chicago.

Baars / Henneman / Mengelberg,Sliptong,"“Though Ig Henneman is often known as a composer of new music, she is also an improviser.

Ab Baars,And She Speaks: A Collection of Ballads,"“Few things are as radical as Ab Baars' solo music.

Gustafsson / Nilssen-Love / Asmamaw,Baro 101,"“Baro 101 totally undermines the notion that improv is a stale, overly-intellectualised genre for Western, coffee-swilling virtuosos. It’s warm and it swings, engaging and challenging at once. This is, to me, what improv should be, and I would happily place Baro 101 alongside the seminal works of Peter Brotzmann, AMM and John Russell. Time will tell if this has quite the impact those guys did, but I certainly hope so.” - Joseph Burnett",Catalytic Sound,https://terriehesselsterprecords.bandcamp.com/album/baro-101?label=1651542186&tab=music,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/mats-gustafsson-paal-nilssen-love-masele-asmamaw-baro-101/s-JiGFhEEoiWO
Icepick,Hexane,"“This is one of my favorite trios, which is not surprising because it features three of my favorite musicians.

The Ex,Starters Alternators,"""The Ex have remained Amsterdam's best kept secret for a decade, despite a plethora of LPs, all with great lyrics... like its predecessors, it's a throat-grabbing, post-punk smacker that also lets in the more hushed, unsettling underbelly of the genre. Whether the band is more restrained, or full-throttle, these Dutchmen remain wired, compelling, and thoughtfully raw...

Entr'acte,Soigne Ta Droite,“There is nothing that I love more than composing for and working with a large ensemble.

Joe Morris & Agustí Fernández,Ambrosia,"“Mixing conventional and extended techniques, melodies and harmonies, this duo creates a shifting landscape of sound.
