Tashi Dorji,Blue Twelve ,"""It doesn't sound like a guitar. But I know you like guitars, so don't let that put you off. It sounds less like an instrument, in fact, than many voices -- swooping and surrounding the listener. Whispering lovely nonsense-poetry in one ear while their shadows quietly circle and shout abominations in the other ear. You know Forbidden Planet? Yeah, sort of like that. Not music so much as a real-time dialog of different distinct voices, each with its own character. Except it is a guitar. One guitar. All recorded live, improvised, with no edits or overdubs. What's more, this is Tashi Dorji's first ever electric guitar release. His previous cassettes and download albums have stoked up feverish praise from fans. Ben Chasny was so impressed with Tashi's gorgeous acoustic improvisations that he formed a label -- Hermit Hut -- specifically to put out Tashi's music."" - Forced Exposure.

Rempis / Morris / Reid / Baker,Nettles,"""In the summer of 2013, guitarist Joe Morris decided to thoroughly acquaint himself with the vibrant Chicago creative music scene. Although he’d worked with plenty of Chicago musicians over the years, including regular collaborations with percussionist Hamid Drake and reedist Ken Vandermark, it had been many years since Morris had spent any significant time in the city. So he undertook a series of concerts, organized by Vandermark, which placed him in a number of different contexts alongside many of his Chicago-based counterparts, including this string-heavy date at Elastic Arts."" - Aerophonic Records.

It’s almost like free jazz bingo. If you had “Astral Spirits” in the label column, you win! The title Two Duos plays like a droll joke, once you start listening. Both halves contain breadth and depth well beyond the simplicity of a duo. Anker and Lonberg-Holm’s duet plays on all their strengths. Their extended improvisation takes a kind of narrative approach with the titling, “Ice King” / “Melt” / “The Frigid Air” / “Cold Only Hurts Those Who Feel,” and the playing is thrillingly free.

Rempis / Johnston / Ochs,Spectral,"""This free-improvising trio came together in the fall of 2011, when Rempis journeyed to the West Coast to discover some things about his compatriots on the Bay Area improving scene. Trumpeter Johnston, a frequent visitor to Chicago, where the two had collaborated in several different settings in the years prior, suggested this trio lineup for a performance at Oakland’s Uptown Nightclub. Although Rempis hadn’t worked with Ochs before, the latter’s renowned experience in the all-horn lineup of ROVA made the idea especially appealing. From the first few notes, that initial meeting flowed comfortably, yet in totally unexpected ways, with all three making logical structural decisions that gave their improvisations the feel of through-composed pieces. Eager to continue developing this language that the three later came to dub “invisible architecture,” Rempis made a follow-up trip to the Bay Area in the spring of 2012 for two more concerts and a studio recording session. Spectral, the first document of their work, was the result of that visit, and shows an improvising trio playing out an audible game of chess. Not satisfied with simply existing in the moment, these three combine sensibilities to look many moves ahead, setting each other up time and again to capitalize on structural possibilities that give rare and meaningful form to an otherwise very spontaneous music. - ""Aerophonic Records"".

Tashi Dorji & Tyler Damon,Both Will Escape,"""Both Will Escape is the debut full-length between electric guitarist Tashi Dorji and percussionist Tyler Damon. In the long tradition of string/drum duets -- from Bailey & Bennink to Haino & Yoshida -- these two cleave out their own unmapped continent of sound. Across four pieces they connect lashes of ecstatic intensity and outer reaches of texture and timbre. At times Dorji's brutal electric torrents meld into Damon's metal and tonal abstractions. These two developed in parallel for years before forging an ongoing duo in 2015. Dorji has released a string of startling acoustic albums that've rescrambled six-string notions of jazz/improv/Flamenco. Damon's rethink of overtone and rhythm is enraptured as it's stupefying in solo exhibitions or with Mars Williams, Darin Gray and Thee Open Sex."" - Family Vineyard.

Rempis / Abrams / Ra / Baker,Perihelion,"""This sophomore release by the working trio of Dave Rempis, Joshua Abrams, and Avreeayl Ra shows a band doubling down on the slow, patient approach to improvising that characterized their first release, 2014’s Aphelion. The trio continues to pulsate, expanding ever outwards, yet returning to a central core each time to launch their next adventure. The live sets presented on this new two-disc set document that musical expansion and contraction within the trio, but also take things a step further as the band adds enigmatic keyboardist Jim Baker to the fold as a special guest for disc two. Baker’s a logical choice to meet up with these three; his own trio with Abrams and Ra, although a sporadic grouping, dates back to the early aught’s, and he’s worked with both in countless other contexts across many years. Similarly, a multitude of collaborations between he and Rempis date back to the late 1990’s. On Perihelion, these two overlapping circles spiral seamlessly into focus to demonstrate the gravitational strength of a central core built by decades of shared history."" - Aerophonic Records.

The Rempis / Daisy Duo,Second Spring,"""Dave Rempis and Tim Daisy are two musicians whose work has helped to define an entire generation of Chicago improvisers. Having performed together since they both hit the Chicago scene in the fall of 1997, these two have joined forces on hundreds of performances and dozens of recordings with notable groups including Triage, The Engines, The Rempis Percussion Quartet, The Vandermark Five, and countless other ad hoc groupings. Their duo pairing has a similarly long history whose roots date back to the countless all-day/all-night workshop sessions that Daisy hosted in his garage practice space in the late 90’s, where these two rolled up their sleeves together for the first time, laying the foundation for a lengthy and fruitful set of collaborations. On this recording, a follow-up to their 2005 release “Back To The Circle” on the Okkadisk imprint, the two capitalize on these deep roots to produce an almost telepathic interaction in their improvisations. Never willing to settle into comfortable territory though, the two continue to push each other into new sonic realms, repeatedly pulling the carpet out from one another as the ground becomes too firm under foot."" - Aerophonic Records.

Documenting a concert from the landmark venue Hallwalls in Buffalo, NY, the trio follows up on their previous release, 2014’s Spectral, having taken their unique approach to spontaneous composition to the next level through the crucible that only touring can provide. On this new recording they tackle two pieces that are significantly more extended than the ones documented on their earlier release, while still employing the same core strategy that made that recording so compelling; an ability to look far down the road in order to anticipate the larger structures that can emerge from even the slightest gesture.

"Peter Evans, Agustí Fernández & Mats Gustafsson",Kopros Lithos,"""As an archeological project, this recording is a rare artifact, documenting the collaboration of three important improvisers whose technique is paraded on each track. Sometimes they choose to walk a minimalist line, Fernández exploring the piano's insides—much of the time mimicking a percussionist—while Gustafsson and Evans play with breathy sounds. In other spots, Gustafsson delivers his now-patented shout-smack saxophone punch and Evans brings his growling rumbles. Without the persistence of beat or the bounds of meter, the trio is free to exercise some serious kopros noise-making, Some may think these challenging sounds merde, others an instant archaeological treasure."" –All About Jazz",Catalytic Sound,https://gustafsson1.bandcamp.com/album/kopros-lithos,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/kopros-lithos/s-S4tW85xrevT

Ex Orkest,Een Rondje Holland,"""Rather than simply grafting cheesy strings to original songs, these Dutch noiseniks have bent a 20-piece orchestra to their own polyrhythmic, cacophonous needs. The result is pure sonic excess. Latinate brass fanfares slur, goaded by jagged slashing from cellos as the five members of The Ex raise a tumult. The music is a delirious pummeling, all energy and rhythm on cuts like ""Kokend Asfalt"" (which is a reworked ""State of Shock"" from ""Scrabbling at the Lock"" with cellist Tom Cora) or the Stravinsky-meets-Stooges ""Meer Nieuws"" (which alters ""River,"" from ""Dizzy Spells"")."" -Kevin Williams, Chicago Tribune",Catalytic Sound,https://terriehesselsterprecords.bandcamp.com/album/een-rondje-holland,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/een-rondje-holland/s-FLel2uc8fZx

Now they are here for you! The omnipotent living legend Paal-Nilssen Love clashes head to head with bass prodigy Christian Meaas Svendsen on bass, playing with 2-3 bows, cheek, voice, hands and feet. In the midst of the battle we find Yong Yandsen, a high- octane Malaysian sax virtuoso who virtually explodes on stage combining the best of Japanese noise and European free-jazz-or-whatever-you- wanna-call-it together with the aforementioned gentlemen.

Terrie Hessels & Ab Baars,Hef,"""In English there's a related idiom: Dutch courage. That's when intoxication makes you fearless. Perhaps a fitting image for Ab Baars and Terrie Ex on their first record of duets, ""Hef"". I'm not referring to literal drunkenness, of course, but a figurative image of being tanked, a thoroughly internalized sense of dizzy, giddy musical interaction, bravery to try things you'd know you wouldn't/ shouldn't when sober. Ab is creative music's official drunken master (past masters: Ben Webster, Archie Shepp), and the marvelous Mr. Ex is a very worthy drunkboxing partner. In Ab's tenor especially, I hear this approach (keep in mind, Chan only turns to drunken boxing when pushed to do so!) - a loopy, wild, off-kilter phraseology that's precise and imprecise in the right balance, or rather in the right relation. In the twosome's opener, ""Oud Over"", Ab lurches and sways like a sot. But beware, 'cause just when you think he'll topple over, he turns into a bloodthirsty silver machine, attacking the jugular and slicing in tandem with Terrie's electric chicken-scratch scrapple of strings. Listen on ""Stokdutter"" as the guitarist's metallic shards combust behind Baars' slow-motion clarinet, unfazed by sudden motion - two temporalities superimposed, the unreality of unitary chronological time for a buzzed man. The drunken master works at his own pace. What's it take to make music like ""Hef""? A liter and a half of Dutch courage."" –John Corbett, Chicago, January 2000",Catalytic Sound,https://terriehesselsterprecords.bandcamp.com/album/hef,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/hef/s-f04vFqFjqW1
Christof Kurzmann & Ken Vandermark,Consequent Duos: series 2e,"“Consequent Duos: series 2e//Christof Kurzmann & Ken Vandermark” (AGR/SvA-017) indicates a stunning musical interplay that’s been developed through years of concerts together. Though this sonic dialog is informed by their mutual performance history, there is no attempt to replicate their collaborative work in other bands. Often the music documented here doesn’t even sound as though it’s been created by a duo. Frequently it has the impact of a wide ranging series of concertos- with Vandermark’s contributions falling literally in the center of Kurzmann’s improvised and layered “orchestrations.”",Catalytic Sound,https://vandermark1.bandcamp.com/album/consequent-duos-series-2e,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/consequent-duos-series-2e/s-UkSp7cRBzWW
Perch Hen Brock & Rain,Live @ Jazz Happening,"(...) This intersection of the newer Dutch swing and post- Downtown New York sound evidences a newly refreshed improvised music. Not free jazz, nor exactly free improvisation, the five pieces make mannerly and urbane connections. It's difficult to define a leader for this quartet, maybe because so much is shared. ""Brock"" opens with Laubrock and Baars trading saxophone notes from the upper and lower registers until Rainey pushes the ""go"" button with his drumming. After a pause at the midway point, Henneman's viola signals a slower tempo and an abandonment of all aggression. She opens ""Rain"" with a high-wire performance that calls for the dancing sticks of Rainey, Baars' clarinet, and the bird-like calls of Laubrock's soprano saxophone. The music develops as a piece of chamber music albeit never abandoning the heated flames of improvisation. Baars' shakuhachi playing is mystical on ""Tampere"" and ""Hen,"" both pieces that gather momentum as improvised music, but coalesce as seemingly composed music. Such prestidigitation is evidence of music making at the highest levels."" –Mark Corroto **** allaboutjazz.com",Catalytic Sound,https://abbaarsighennemanwig.bandcamp.com/album/live-the-jazz-happening,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/live-jazz-happening/s-TQ76IQ8KbiW

Henneman Strijkkwartet,Pes,"""The string quartet is an instrumental combination most often heard in many different genres of classical music; in fact, it is one of the standard groupings for this music, whereas it is a more rare enterprise in improvised music. Certainly there are examples of string players getting together to improvise, but the results can not so often be compared favorably with great classical string quartets. The Dutch viola player and composer Henneman is making great progress in this area however, as she has found a regular group of musicians to work with, evidenced by the six-year span of recording dates. The difficult task of integrating composition and improvisation is carried out with aplomb by this group: they actually make it sound easy. A nice combination of male and female energy exists in this group, as well as a combination of Dutch musicians and so-called ex-patriot Americans who have settled in the Netherlands. The players are comfortable working in a traditional, melodic, and harmonic manner but also can and do go way out. Everything that happens makes logical sense, and this is music that reveals rich layers of detail upon repeated listenings."" - Eugene Chadbourne (All Music)",Catalytic Sound,https://abbaarsighennemanwig.bandcamp.com/album/pes,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/pes/s-3Os70kM6UHr
