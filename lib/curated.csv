Mats Gustafsson & Hamid Drake,For Don Cherry,"""Rhythmic virtuoso Hamid Drake and reeds innovator Mats Gustafsson deliver a jaw-dropping and all-too-brief set recorded in Chicago on Oct. 19, 1995, the day of Don Cherry’s death and recorded by Jim O'Rourke. One of the few live records to make this listener earnestly wish she’d been in attendance, Drake and Gustafsson’s meeting is a perfect example of the phenomenal synergy possible between two musicians. The two in question are an ideal match; both temper the muscularity of their playing with sensitivity and musical sophistication. Neither artist allows the other the option of sitting on his heels at any point; this recording is challenging, intense, and enjoyable from start to finish."" –Susie Jae, ON AIR magazine, WKCR 89.9 FM (New York)",Catalytic Sound,https://gustafsson1.bandcamp.com/album/for-don-cherry,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/for-don-cherry/s-CxZRQ0e9yEH

Tashi Dorji,Blue Twelve ,"""It doesn't sound like a guitar. But I know you like guitars, so don't let that put you off. It sounds less like an instrument, in fact, than many voices -- swooping and surrounding the listener. Whispering lovely nonsense-poetry in one ear while their shadows quietly circle and shout abominations in the other ear. You know Forbidden Planet? Yeah, sort of like that. Not music so much as a real-time dialog of different distinct voices, each with its own character. Except it is a guitar. One guitar. All recorded live, improvised, with no edits or overdubs. What's more, this is Tashi Dorji's first ever electric guitar release. His previous cassettes and download albums have stoked up feverish praise from fans. Ben Chasny was so impressed with Tashi's gorgeous acoustic improvisations that he formed a label -- Hermit Hut -- specifically to put out Tashi's music."" - Forced Exposure.

"Andy Moor, Anne James & Thurston Moore",Herectics,"Heretics is a series of portraits of radical heretical figures found throughout the history of schismatic thinking.Heretics like Caravaggio, William Burroughs, Jose Mujica, Marquis de Sade and Johnny Rotten, fascinated the artists. These influential figures are presented here in the form of poetic texts and catchy melodies combined with experimental noise. - With the addition of ex-Sonic Youth guitarist, singer and songwriter Thurston Moore, Anne-James Chaton and Andy Moor’s more than a decade long collaboration becomes an exciting trio. They researched and created the material for Heretics during a residency in the French port of St Nazaire, in July 2014.

Rempis / Abrams / Ra / Baker,Perihelion,"""This sophomore release by the working trio of Dave Rempis, Joshua Abrams, and Avreeayl Ra shows a band doubling down on the slow, patient approach to improvising that characterized their first release, 2014’s Aphelion. The trio continues to pulsate, expanding ever outwards, yet returning to a central core each time to launch their next adventure. The live sets presented on this new two-disc set document that musical expansion and contraction within the trio, but also take things a step further as the band adds enigmatic keyboardist Jim Baker to the fold as a special guest for disc two. Baker’s a logical choice to meet up with these three; his own trio with Abrams and Ra, although a sporadic grouping, dates back to the early aught’s, and he’s worked with both in countless other contexts across many years. Similarly, a multitude of collaborations between he and Rempis date back to the late 1990’s. On Perihelion, these two overlapping circles spiral seamlessly into focus to demonstrate the gravitational strength of a central core built by decades of shared history."" - Aerophonic Records.

Lytton is a personal hero of mine, and I have only recently started digging more and more into Wacshmann’s remarkable discography. What is striking to me about this trio is the way that Vandermark negotiates his role in the ensemble. It’s as if he jumped into the deep end of the pool, unafraid, and without a life jacket on.

Perch Hen Brock & Rain,Live @ Jazz Happening,"(...) This intersection of the newer Dutch swing and post- Downtown New York sound evidences a newly refreshed improvised music. Not free jazz, nor exactly free improvisation, the five pieces make mannerly and urbane connections. It's difficult to define a leader for this quartet, maybe because so much is shared. ""Brock"" opens with Laubrock and Baars trading saxophone notes from the upper and lower registers until Rainey pushes the ""go"" button with his drumming. After a pause at the midway point, Henneman's viola signals a slower tempo and an abandonment of all aggression. She opens ""Rain"" with a high-wire performance that calls for the dancing sticks of Rainey, Baars' clarinet, and the bird-like calls of Laubrock's soprano saxophone. The music develops as a piece of chamber music albeit never abandoning the heated flames of improvisation. Baars' shakuhachi playing is mystical on ""Tampere"" and ""Hen,"" both pieces that gather momentum as improvised music, but coalesce as seemingly composed music. Such prestidigitation is evidence of music making at the highest levels."" –Mark Corroto **** allaboutjazz.com",Catalytic Sound,https://abbaarsighennemanwig.bandcamp.com/album/live-the-jazz-happening,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/live-jazz-happening/s-TQ76IQ8KbiW
New Monuments,New Earth,"""Another energy jump from the iconic noise trio New Monuments. Featuring Borbetomagus's Don Dietrich on saxophone, violinist/vocalist C. Spencer Yeh, and Graveyards drummer Ben Hall. New Earth sounds like someone stepped on a copy of Mahavishnu Orchestra's Birds of Fire, put it on the turntable, loved what they heard, and pressed it into a CD. Pure spontaneous music from three of the heaviest in contemporary music."" -Pleasure Of The Text",Catalytic Sound,https://natewooleypleasureofthetextsoundamerican.bandcamp.com/album/new-earth,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/new-earth/s-KknVNsyoQsh

Rodrigo Amado / Joe McPhee / Kent Kessler / Chris Corsano ,This Is Our Language ,"""Lisbon’s Rodrigo Amado has chosen a crack team of improvisers with whom to present his vocabulary. With This Is Our Language, he has succeeded in uniting the varied parlances of creative musicians around the world. Over the span of forty-three minutes, Amado has condensed a diverse array of concepts that blossom and mature with each listening. This is a commanding and authoritative recording that should not be missed."" - Peter Gough, Free Jazz Blog.

Anne-James Chaton & Andy Moor,Transfer,"“I love the duo music that Andy has created with the poet Anne-James Chaton. It’s something totally abstract and absolutely concrete at the same time.  This particular album collects the material from a series of 7” singles they made together, all devoted to the exploration of ideas about travel.” - Ken Vandermark. Music By, Guitar – Andy Moor.
