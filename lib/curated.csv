John Butcher & Andy Moor,Experiments With a Leaf,"""The two meet in the middle of the road, so to speak, for this quick half-hour session of maxed-out microtones. It's an excitingly subdued and intense listen, and while it's laudable not to follow the compulsion to load the disc to its 80-minute capacity, the one track that stretches past 10 minutes suggests there's much more ground left for them to cover."" -Kurt Gottschalk.

John Butcher / Tony Buck / Magda Mayas / Burkhard Stangl,Plume,"""The trios on this CD were chosen for their potential, for the not-knowing as much as the knowing, and that’s what we hear; accomplished and profoundly involved music in the making, pushed forward by an ever renewed and intense ability to connect.""

Elisabeth Harnik,Ways of My Hands,"""The fractured, rhythmical and melodic elements of this suite may flow in an erratic, eccentric ways but do gravitate into delicate, arresting structures with their own, inner logic and fascinating architecture, expressing a myriad of sounds, feelings and textures, from soft and gentle to the rough and dense ones.

Wooley / Rempis / Niggenkemper / Corsano,From Wolves to Whales,"“The musicians delve deep into the outside schema of jazz amid a largely aggressive mode of attack.
