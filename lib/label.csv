Anáhuac,Y_y,"""This trio, composed of Juan García (double bass), Ignaz Schick (turntable, sampler, electronics) and Chris Cogburn (electronic, percussion), has been using non-idiomatic improvisation since 2016 to propose a new way in which the audience can approach the concept of sound as an art form. That this album bears the word “ascua” (ember) as its title is quite appropriate, since both of its tracks seem to grow as more elements are thrown into them, just as if it were a sonic wood fire; there’s a hissing, static effect that persists throughout the album -like that of a dusty vinyl record- that effectively emulates the sound of something being slowly consumed by a small fire (as we can appreciate on “scoria”) or it might as well represent a liquid reaching its boiling point, as illustrated on “sudar” climax. This time, however, Anáhuac has found a way to use less elements, and the results are far more great, as every nuance and texture is more noticeable; this helps create a deeper sense of immersion. Each member’s contributions are minimal, but vital. This is not a demonstration of virtuosity or manual dexterity, nor it is a relentless attack on the senses: the purpose is not to trace complex melodic or harmonic contours, nor the careful and methodical confection of typical rhythmic patterns, but a fusion in favor of texture and the exploration of the timbral possibilities each element involved has to offer, while maintaining a sense of balance and direction."" - Densidad25

"Threadbare (Jason Stein, Ben Cruz, Emerson Hunt)",Silver Dollar,"""Their debut album, Silver Dollar, is technically free jazz; but as the album unfolds, it’s easy to hear a strong affinity for ‘70s rock bands like Led Zeppelin, and jazz-rock hybrids like the Mahavishnu Orchestra and Soft Machine. The songs begin delicately, often with one instrument, and gather steam as they go, rising to volcanic crescendos before settling into dense, mesmerizing grooves. On “Threadbare,” in particular, Stein opens the track by seemingly blowing into the clarinet without a reed which, when combined with Hunton’s irregular drum pattern and Cruz’s eerie guitar chords, generates feelings of pending doom. At the four-minute mark, the instrumentalists fall into a Latin rhythm that never quite syncs up; but the track thrives even if the timing is slightly off. Compare that with “24 Mesh Veils” and “Funny Thing Is”: Neither song really takes shape at all. The former slowly trudges along, carried by its murky mix of clarinet and guitar. The latter feels nimble, a hard bop track with light drum taps and bright chords that grow more frenetic by the minute."" - Marcus J Moore, Bandcamp Daily",No Business,https://nobusinessrecords.bandcamp.com/album/threadbare-silver-dollar,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/threadbare-silver-dollar/s-O91TIFgaLIh
Mockūnas / Sakata / Yoshihide / Umezu / Koketsu / Hayashi,Luidas Mockūnas In Residency at Bitches Brew,"""Bitches Brew is the club, not the sound of the music – a night spot in Yokohama where European reedman Liudas Mockunas improvised these performances in the company of a range of different Japanese players! The lineup shifts with each track, as do the horns handled by Mockunas – who blows tenor and soprano sax – plus a very cool ""water prepared soprano sax"" – in the company of Akira Sakata on clarinet and alto, Masayo Koketsu on alto, Eiichi Hayashi on alto, Yoshihide Otomo on guitar, and Kazutoki Umezu on bass clarinet, alto, and soprano! All tracks are nice and long, and filled with the sort of sharp reed interplay you'd know from both the music of Mockunas or Sakata – on titles that include ""Brown Line"", ""Green Line"", ""Red Line"", ""Blue Line"", and ""Yellow Line"" - Dusty Groove",No Business,https://nobusinessrecords.bandcamp.com/album/liudas-mock-nas-in-residency-at-bitches-brew,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/mockunas-sakata-yoshihide-umezu-koketsu-hayashi-in-residency-at-bitches-brew/s-QEVPFZiUCnv
Andrew Lamb / Tom Abbs / Michael Wimberly / Guillermo E. Brown,Rhapsody in Black,"""The music of Rhapsody in Black has a distinctive character: it speaks of gentleness, humility, artfulness and dignified cultural embrace. Sax and flute player, Baba Andrew Lamb wastes no time in manifesting the aforementioned qualities in the opening page of the liner notes. The title of the album addresses a celebration of Black Heritage. The first percussion sounds heard are unavoidably spare and soft, but “initiate” (cf. the title of the first track,“Initiation”) a series of beautifully executed discrete strokes on the bass strings by Lamb's decade long collaborator Tom Abbs. The atmosphere built is environmental, say of the jungle, bearing some kind of tribal significance, haunting yells as testimony. Lambs’ clarinet induces an unique sound aura of calling forth spiritual power that pervades the entire album. The bass creates strong arco and pizzicato voices within the group throughout the recording and seems just as prominent instrumentally as the reeds are. Abbs also sputters and rips short glissandos through the tuba to change up the bass colors. But Lamb sings the most intricate songs; he repeats a phrase, rarely arpeggiates and sculpts sturdy and erect melodies, most often in the same gesture on any instrument he plays whether it is the clarinet, the tenor, metal or wooden flute. The percussionists, Michael Wimberly and Guillermo E. Brown, are integral to the group’s musical process. Lamb describes the percussionists' interaction: ""They play together at the same time or accompany each other taking turns."" The drummers commit to holding up the rhythmic content with undying and varying persistence: with light-handedness on cymbals, snare, woodblocks or bells. The pair keeps the music tight, manages its direction and seals its reverence."" --2012 Lyn Horton ",No Business,https://nobusinessrecords.bandcamp.com/album/rhapsody-in-black,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/andrew-lamb-rhapsody-in-black/s-Mgd1sgdP7wV
Detail (Frode Gjerstad / Johnny Dyani / John Stevens),Day Two,"""Sequenced into two LP-side sized pieces, the disc documents a classic extended example of the trio’s egalitarian ethos. Stevens never overshadows his colleagues and the communication lines remain open even when one or more of the players opts for silent listening over sound-driven input. Gjerstad opens on intentionally furtive soprano, tracing melodic figures against the massive throb of Dyani’s strings and the steady tidal tumble of Stevens’ sticks. The speed increases incrementally with tension building organically apace. There’s a stretch near the end of the first piece that dips dangerously close to longueurs where Gjerstad’s tenor appears briefly bereft of directional purpose, but his partners swiftly swoop in to shore the gap with a shared focus. The B-Side develops more deliberately while exuding equal heat."" - Derek Taylor, Dusted",No Business,https://nobusinessrecords.bandcamp.com/album/day-two,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/detail-gjerstad-dyani-stevens-day-two/s-BleBUP3XumR
Sabu Toyozumi / Mats Gustafsson,Hokusai,"""Hokusai is available in LP with three lengthy tracks or CD with the inclusion of an additional solo performance by Gustafsson and Toyozumi. The three duos presented open with ""Sunflower,"" a piece that enters stealthily enough with barely perceptible baritone saxophone breath and minimal percussive pulse. The spell is broken by the cluck and pop of Gustafsson's saxophone and his vocalizations. Toyozumi follows with his stop-start attack which converts into a jagged blast of energy. The pair work a quiet/loud/quiet approach to great effect, drawing you in then jolting you out. ""Woman With A Cat"" finds Gustafsson hoisting both fluteophone and flute. The interaction rotates around the music's tension and release of energy, Toyozumi as tour director here. The music next presents a solo by each performer. Gustafsson returns to the baritone saxophone, applying minimalist sounds incorporating breathy passages, pops, cluck and his vocalizations. Toyozumi's solo relies on space, utilizing quiet as much as pulse here. The pair reunite for the 20+ minute ""For Ever-Advancing Artistry."" Their music finds a meeting of the minds here, with any hesitation that might have been perceived on the previous interactions dissolved. The finale is a sweat drenched, leave-it-all-on-the- bandstand improvisation."" - Mark Corroto, All About Jazz",No Business,https://nobusinessrecords.bandcamp.com/album/hokusai,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/sabu-toyozumi-mats-gustafsson-hokusai/s-MUyb3bnmNPD

Magda Mayas' Filamental,Confluence,"Magda Mayas composed this piece for an octet comprised of a who's who of the avant-garde. The score consists of 12 photos taken over an hour or so, observing the merging waters of the Rhône and the Arve rivers, the artificial wall dividing them, the earthy, blue and green colors blending. There are as many defining differences as similarities, depending on what one pays attention to but after a while the differences become apparent. A variety of angles, hues, light, excerpts, focusing on one or the other river or on the in-between areas. The score offers the possibility to focus on tiny details, transitional areas, or to stay in one area for a long time over the course of a concert.",Relative Pitch,https://relativepitchrecords.bandcamp.com/album/confluence,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/magda-mayas-filamental-confluence/s-qwbeBSxA2Sx
Zeena Parkins / Mette Rasmussen / Ryan Sawyer,Glass Triangle,"""Parkins’ remarkable, and ever-inventive spectrum of sounds, rarely associated with a conventional harp, is at the center of the intense dynamics of this meeting. Rasmussen suggests the urgent, sharp and ecstatic edge of this trio, always pushing forward, while Sawyer adds like-minded frantic, fast-shifting and fragmented rhythmic patterns, but it is Parkins who cements the syntax of this trio, with her heavily-processed and effects-laden electric harp, but insists on a democratic, conversational interplay. Parkins cleverly crisscrosses the high-octane attacks of Rasmussen and Sawyer on the opening “Begiunners, begges, beattle, belt, believers”, sounding like a twisted electric guitar; she intensifies the mysterious, ritualist atmosphere of “Not Bygone, Just Biggone” with eerie, ambient sounds; and she anchors the nervous energy of Rasmussen and Sawyer on “Flod of Trees” with a storm of alien noises."" - Eyal Hareuveni, Free Jazz Blog",Relative Pitch,https://relativepitchrecords.bandcamp.com/album/glass-triangle,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/zeena-parkins-mette-rasmussen-ryan-sawyer-glass-triangle/s-8kicfqEkY14

Keir Neuringer / Shayna Dulberger / Julius Masri,Dromedaries II,"""Dromedaries II presents four improvisations moving between 10 and 13 minutes. Opening improvisation ‘Both’ starts from a theme played by the bassist and repeated over. Drummer Masri joins by playing maniacal shifting patterns and on top Neuringer plays extended lines that quickly become increasingly intense. In the second part, the drummer is in the forefront with sequences of repeated patterns that gradually change in interaction with the bass. Near the end the sax returns once more, staying in the background. ‘Rifts’ starts with a rhythmic pattern by drums and bass. Neuringer joins with his penetrating and slightly dissonant sound. He has his very own distinct and conjuring tone. Drumming by Masri is impressive. He plays his patterns in a non-jazz way influenced by ethnic music, that invites Neuringer to play his inspired lines. ‘Ether’ starts with a very free and energetic dialogue of drums and bass. After the sax joins it develops into very jumpy improvisation. Very wild. In contrast, the closing improvisation ‘Thereafter’ is a more modest one. It is built again on ethnic-inspired percussive patterns that propel the improvisation forward. A strong statement by a trio searching and finding its own voice.""

Wadada Leo Smith / Douglas R. Ewart / Mike Reed,Sun Beans of Shimmering Light,"""The album’s opener, “Constellations And Conjunctional Spaces” sets the tone; Smith and Ewart’s playing melds seamlessly, while Reed’s flourishes add tasteful rhythmic and tonal accents. On “Super Moon Rising,” Smith’s bright tone and Reed’s playing are particularly impressive, providing a dynamic and ever-shifting bed of percussion for Smith and Ewart to play both in and around. “Unknown Forces” begins by showcasing Smith’s strength as a soloist. Smith’s lines are soulful and patiently phrased, jutting out between each daring moment of silence. On Sun Beans of Shimmering Light, these experienced players carry on a legacy of experimental music and boundless creativity that started so many decades ago. That Smith continues to present music from the very cutting edge of jazz and improvised music after so many years of challenging the genre’s conventions is an impressive and inspiring feat.

Chris Williams & Patrick Shiroishi,Sans Soleil,"...but more importantly Sans Soleil comes across less as a trumpet/saxophone duo album and more in line with the sounds of Art Ensemble of Chicago or other forward thinking ""sound"" ensembles.  Synthesizers, glockenspeil and many other objects interject as foreground and background sounds through the entirety of the album. Coming in at over 60 minutes (including the digital bonus track) there is a lot of music to digest here on Sans Soleil, and that might be the best part of all. Both Williams & Shiroishi spent plenty of time working through their respective arsenals of instruments - Williams on Trumpet, Cornet, Flugelhorn and more and Shiroishi on Alto, Tenor, Bari, Soprano & Sopranino saxophones as well as Clarinet and more.

[Ahmed],Nights on Saturn (communication),"""The music does have a hypnotic appeal, particularly when all four musicians succumb fully to the piece's over-the-top mania. Even the most hair-raising moments of Super Majnoon don't reach the volcanic amplitude on display here. The live setting enhances the effect, and the crowd's enthusiastic responses are well-captured throughout the recording. While some listeners may desire a bit more dynamic contrast, or occasionally tire of the essentially iterative quality of the music, there is a fascinating aspect to hearing Wright and Thomas explore and interrogate the figures they conjure—at times seemingly trying to beat them into submission—while seeking even more ecstatic heights. For its sheer cathartic power, Nights on Saturn is indeed an accomplishment.""

Kuzu,The Glass Delusion,"""Kuzu recordings are highly instinctual and intuitional; the same can be said about any quality improv music unit. Where Kuzu makes its mark is that each of its members, Dave Rempis (saxes), Tashi Dorji (guitar) and Tyler Damon (drums), are highly individualistic musicians who play their instruments well outside the bounds of conformity. There are sounds you don’t often hear from each of these instruments and even less so as a group. Add to that their penchant for zigging when you expect them to zag, and it all adds up to adventurous and rewarding listening experience."" - S. Victor Aaron, Something Else!

Michael Foster & Ben Bennett,Contractions,"""The intimate yet stormy duet feature both Foster and Bennett all over their instruments, pushing themselves and their instruments sonic ranges into the most extreme terrains. Foster talks and shouts through the saxes mouthpieces and often uses his instruments as percussive instruments in addition to his strong rhythmic articulation while Bennett blows on his membranes as if there were reeds instruments. Both have developed such a close affinity that they can shift the level of intensity and energy within a second or instantly alternate between a muscular, roaring blow-out and an abstract, almost silent sonic searches. There is a sense of thematic development to Foster and Bennett performance as both communicate a kind of story full of hair-raising adventures and wild twists that demands a certain showmanship.

Amirtha Kidambi & Matteo Liberatore,Neutral Love,"""This time, we’re shifting across to Twitter so The Wire editor Derek Walmsley can make a recommendation – ‘Neutral Love’ by Amirtha Kidambi & Matteo Liberatore. Derek writes, “I absolutely love this” and I can understand why. It’s absolutely enveloping, gorgeous, strung out with dissonance and texture and a silence all the more eloquent for the occasional disruption and distortion. Or, Avant Music News puts it, “Kidambi eschews singing for drones, mouth and throat noises, and plaintive tones, unbending in her lack of orthodoxy. Liberatore provides his own drones as well as long-held notes and dissonant chords on an undistorted electric guitar. While only voice and guitar are credited, a certain amount of processing may be present as well.“"" - Everett True",Astral Editions,https://aeneutrallove.bandcamp.com/album/neutral-love,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/amirtha-kidambi-matteo-liberatore-neutral-love/s-xaPrDti4Upg
Landon Caldwell & Nick Yeck-Stauffer,Unity in Isolation,"""And what I’m feeling right now in an immense drifting sensation, lost in the trance of Landon Caldwell’s organ drone and synthesizer keys; it’s a deviously simple ambient core you can imagine. Completely ruling side A, the seventeen minute suite, “Ugly Connection,” finds Nick Yeck-Stuaffer swirling through the ambience with his otherworldly pocket trumpet blasts. The two Crazy Doberman members had some of the most notable moments on Illusory Expansion from last year — in fact, I’m quite certain Staffer’s trumpet is the opening note! Here though, they really chew the scenery and spread out like the ocean floor. Caldwell’s hypnotic keys try to stay locked into a reverent melody as Stauffer’s trumpet playing reaches its most punchdrunk at the suite’s climax.

Gryphon Rue & Merche Blasco,North of the Future,"The shimmering Super Tender introduces us to North Of The Future’s entrancing sound worlds, equal parts elegy, experiment, and sonic prism capturing 2020’s wake. North Of The Future is a homebound duet between Rue and Blasco with instrumental interlocutors. The scarcely governable voice of Blasco’s EMS Synthi AKS (“Cintia”) and her singing saw entangle signals with Rue’s singing saw, harmonium, and custom modular synths (“Fritz”). A rare model from 1972, Cintia’s frayed circuitry gives the synth a special character – she interjects, digresses, changes the conversation. Ffffffffffff. Zeeeeerrrrt. Pft Pfa Pfta. At times in the music Cintia’s temperament is directly invoked: the comedic squeals which burst forth from the droning opening chords of Cintia On Fritz were elicited by rolling an orange up and down Cintia’s conductive keyboard. These human-like sounds are reinforced by the voices of the saws calling across the album.",Astral Editions,https://aerueblasco.bandcamp.com/album/north-of-the-future,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/gryphon-rue-merche-blasco-north-of-the-future/s-v88Cq5Ffwdg
Dorji / McColm / Meadows,The Power of Water,"""Tashi Dorji (of Kuzu), Ian McColm (of Heart of The Ghost) and Frank Meadows (of The Library of Babel), are each veterans of the DIY avant-garde and free jazz worlds, but this album marks the first time the trio collaborated on tape. Based on the strength of this wild performance, the meeting of these astoundingly creative minds was severely overdue. Throughout the record, the group creates highly-textured seas of tense and feral sound, often bordering on the atonal. Dorji plucks odd and twangy notes on guitar while Meadows creates menacing guttural drones on his double bass while McColm attacks a wide assortment of percussion instruments and objects with a rabid fierceness."" - Record Crates United",Trouble in Mind,https://tashidorjiianmccolmfrankmeadows.bandcamp.com/album/the-power-,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/tashi-dorji-ian-mccolm-frank-meadows-the-power-of-water/s-On3psaItxOZ
Landon Caldwell,Deep Strand,"""If your Friday is looking for a little comedown, then the new cassette from Landon Caldwell (Crazy Doberman, Creeping Pink, Thee Open Sex) should do the trick. A part of Trouble in Mind’s explorer’s series, the solo set from Caldwell explores an ambient cosmic float, wafting in on synth clouds thick and satisfying. A weary sax turn the album closer, “What Seems Like the End Is Also A Beginning” into a welcome melt into the atmosphere. As Caldwell, aided here by Tom Lageveen, leads the listener into the light the boundaries between molecules begin to dissolve.

The outfit brings a sprawling 70-minute affair to the table with patch-working motorik rhythms, ambient synth trances, post-punk dub, and psychedelic shredders. As comfortable skronking off into astral heights as they are sludging through the muck, Writhing Squares’ unapologetic cacophony is a true testament to the shrieking discord of our present times.

Mac Blackout,Love Profess,"""An album that starts with the sort of free jazz that feels at least familiar, things move quickly beyond ""Wandering Spheres"" and into other territory entirely. ""Forever"" finds Mac using sax and faint keyboard samples to craft something nearly ambient, but thoroughly unsettling, while ""Magic Hour 2020"", with vocal samples from a younger Mac Blackout, is more Fad Gadget than John Coltrane. Elsewhere, ""Revolutionary Tide"" uses horn honks to punctuate a ruminative exploration of electronica, while the lovely clsoer ""Dear Mom"" reminded me of an Underworld number, or something from Eno. Love Profess is going to get hyped as a jazz record and that's unfortunate. It's really something else entirely, and it's likely going to disappoint anyone looking for jazz. That said, it's sure to inspire anyone who's looking for something bravely iconoclastic.

Matchess,Huizkol,"The seven updrafts of Huizkol are an opportunity to engage with your own skepticism or belief in the effects of sound on the body. The album consists of 7 tracks on each side, 7 minutes each, a meditation on the dualities of sevens. The Active mix is suited to listening while doing, and the Passive mix is intended for devoted attention to inner reality. The theory of brainwave entrainment suggests that through sustained listening brain activity will adapt to the rate of beating binaural frequencies. Huizkol gradually raises this rate to an energetic centerpiece before returning to an ultimately relaxed state.

Bil Vermette,Hunting For Planet 9,"""Bil Vermette has been making ambient and electronic soundscapes for more than 40 years, and his new album, Hunting for Planet 9, won’t disappoint fans looking for another collection of instrumental, synthesizer-heavy space waves to add to their playlist. The Berwyn musician became known for his hypnotic compositions as a member of late-70s synth collective VCSR, and after the band split in the early 80s, Vermette began self-releasing solo work on his own Rainforest Productions label, starting with 1984’s Katha Visions (reissued in 2013 by the Galactic Archive label run by Reader contributor Steve Krakow, in conjunction with Permanent Records). Vermette’s sound is rooted in the music of pioneering electronic groups such as Tangerine Dream and Cluster, and on Hunting for Planet 9 he continues on his galaxy quest with melodic, gently celestial tracks such as “Saturn’s Rings” and “Kuiper Belt.” The album begins with the ominous “Space #8,” whose loud, dissonant patchwork of sound feels like it could propel you to the darkest corners of the Milky Way—and then the next track, “Surface of Titania,” arrives with a gentle bounce to return you to the comforts of the solar system.

FACS,Present Tense,"Chicago trio FACS never stop pushing forward; they’ve honed and refined their stark, minimal scrape and clatter for four years and counting, having risen out of the ashes of beloved Chicago band Disappears in 2018 with the bone-rattling intensity of Negative Houses. After three albums in the past three years, the trio return in 2021 with Present Tense, their fourth album and perhaps their sharpest statement as a band. Opener “XOUT” barrels forward like a tank, with Case’s guitar chiming like warning bells, until the climax comes crashing down, glitching out near the close. “Strawberry Cough” comes next, its fusion of corporeal playing and stately, electronic heartbeats punctured by random bursts of noise or backwards masked sounds. “Alone Without”, a track originally recorded for Adult Swim’s 2020 singles series appears next, albeit in different form; more menacing and serpentine. Side two opens with “General Public”, taking the loud/quiet dynamic as a jumping off point for the song’s unsettling seasick vibe. ‘How To See In the Dark” offers a brief respite, with its persistent, dark quietude that lingers until the song’s end. “Present Tense”, the album’s title track, offers up its first truly weird moment mid-song when the song changes mood distinctly, and the music drops out save for Case’s guitar and vocals. The album’s final track, the densely packed “Mirrored”, begins with a restrained, post-rock shuffle. The mind-scrambling cacophony that comes next takes its time to roll in, but once it does, it comes in waves, flipping back onto itself multiple times until it’s folded into oblivion.

Mountain Movers,World What World,"Mountain Movers arguably are the perfect band for all the true “heads” out there. The New Haven quartet have been at it for 15 years, and the “newest” lineup (now at it for well over a decade; vocalist/guitarist Dan Greene, bassist Rick Omonte, guitarist Kryssi Battalene and drummer Ross Menze) have firmly grasped what it takes to fry brains; achingly beautiful melodies buoyed by a life raft of white-hot guitar scree and mind-melting feedback. “World What World” is the band’s eighth album and third for Trouble In Mind Records.",Trouble in Mind,https://themountainmovers.bandcamp.com/album/world-what-world,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/mountain-movers-world-what-world/s-xeiUgdGTHFK

Joe McPhee,The Willisau Concert,"""Asked which of his out-of-print records he’d like to see available again, multi-instrumentalist Joe McPhee’s response was immediate: The Willisau Concert! Recorded at the Swiss festival that gave it its name in 1975, it appeared a year later as Hat Hut B, the second of the new label’s great letter series. It came packaged gorgeously in a double-gatefold with artist Klaus Baumgärtner’s stunning pen-and-ink work on the inside and out and a little hand-colored Swiss flag on the interior of each copy. Returning to the music, it’s easy to hear why McPhee holds it so dear. He’s in absolute top form on tenor and soprano saxophones, ranging from the relaxed and confident Afro-conscious feel of Nation Time to areas of more diffuse and textural investigation. John Snyder’s analog synthesizer is brilliant and hyperbolic, a surprisingly hand-in-glove match for McPhee, not dissimilar to their collaboration on the CjR release Pieces of Light. South African drummer Makaya Ntshoko is the surprise element, a guest whose sensitivity and warmth are everywhere evident, even when he kicks the energy up a notch. Along with McPhee originals, this reissue includes a never-released bonus, their take on the classic “God Bless the Child,” a total heartbreaker. The CD has been designed as a facsimile cover of the LP, respecting the beautiful and original graphic work on this classic record. Never before available in any digital form, remastered from the original tapes, The Willisau Concert is restored to its place as one of McPhee’s masterpieces."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey

Willem Breuker / Han Bennink,New Acoustic Swing Duo,"""Late in 1967, saxophonist Willem Breuker and drummer Han Bennink recorded the first LP for the new artist-run free improvised music label, ICP Records. New Acoustic Swing Duo was an instant classic, and remains one of the most enduring documents of Dutch improvised music ever recorded. With Breuker’s omnidirectional reed work, which ranges from plaintive to excoriating, occasional sneering tone adds a kind of ironic twist to the expressive outpouring. He could be as explosive as Peter Brötzmann, but Breuker has a razor sharp wit and sense of humor. Since this recording, Bennink has gone on to be seated among the royalty of jazz and improvised music drummers. At the time, he was a fresh-faced 25-year-old, hauling around increasingly immense kits with heaps of percussion flotsam and jetsam, playing tabla and vibrapan, and sparking it all with tsunami energy. Keep in mind, Coltrane and Ali had just recorded Interstellar Space (which would not be issued until 1974), and the economical drum/sax lineup was by no means yet a standard in improvised music. Shortly after recording this, Breuker and Bennink would join Brötzmann to record Machine Gun, another European free music keystone. Somehow, despite its historical importance and aesthetic magnificence, New Acoustic Swing Duo has never been available as a stand-alone CD. Remastered from original tapes, this reissue includes the original cover with the “ICP 001” hand-stamp, as well as several versions of the handmade covers designed by Bennink, drawn from Mats Gustafsson’s wonderful collection. Finally, as a special bonus, the two-disc package includes a legendary concert by Breuker and Bennink, recorded in Essen, Germany, in 1968, released here for the first time."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/new-acoustic-swing-duo,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/willem-breuker-han-bennink-new-acoustic-swing-duo/s-bK8BWiEDkxu
Paul Flaherty,Aria Nativa,"""Aria Nativa is more than Paul Flaherty's third solo saxophone album; it merges rhapsodic avant garde music, patriotic dream verse, and mortality into a frighteningly pure work of audio, visual and literary sledge. Recorded during a pair of 2007 performances, its four pieces capture lifeblood in stunning detail from foot stomps to gut hollers and crowd roars as Flaherty's free power blues dips into the well of wretchedness yet emerges with pumping fists of mirth. It's the sorta record that splays naked the artist for all: equal parts wise ass and universal vision."" - Family Vineyard.

And while music doesn't ripen like a wheel of pungent cheese, who's to say it doesn't sound a little better knowing that we may not have had the opportunity to hear it at all. The world is a much different place now than it was in 2008, and that makes looking ahead to 2028 and beyond all the more unsettling. We can only hope that someone, somewhere is cooking up a little surprise to tuck away for us until then. Something to blow away the existential dread with the sheer power of its sound. Thanks to Joe and Mats, as unintentional as it may have been I needed this music right now at this moment."" - Nick Metzger, Squidco

Zeena Parkins • Wobbly,Triplicates,"""Triplicates is a series of improvisations between Zeena Parkins, playing her singular electric harp, and Jon Leidecker, aka Wobbly, playing an instrument that generates electrical feedback. Their outputs are routed to a series of simple listening devices, machines designed to sing along with the melodies they believe themselves to be hearing, although they are often fascinatingly wrong. It quickly becomes difficult to determine the boundaries of each participant's contribution: acoustic source, electronic conductor, or triplicate."" - Relative Pitch

Josh Berman / Paul Lytton / Jason Roebke,Trio Correspondences,"""Berman’s puckered tone, fatback licks and tart smears—as ever bridging the gap between the garrulous, vocalic excursions of Ellington trumpeters like Bubber Miley and Rex Stewart and modern seekers like Wadada Leo Smith and Nate Wooley--are steadily buffeted by the rhythm section’s shifting gambits. The bassist unfurls deep, woody lines and the drummer peppers his flow with wonderfully jarring, chaotic accents, but despite the turbulence they forge an inexorable sense of forward motion, providing a platform for the cornetist to toggle masterfully between lyric flurries and knotted outbursts. Unlike the airtight miniatures on A Dance and a Hop, these pieces allow the players to resituate the same language onto a wide-open plane—pushing and pulling in changing directions and allowing spontaneous motifs to play out fully, although each musician never lets any single notion overstay it’s welcome."" - Peter Margasak

Billy Bang / William Parker,Medicine Buddha,"""Bang plays a slow, rapturous melody over an arco bass drone in the title track, before leaving Parker to his own devices. With bow in hand the bassist fuses gentle and rough sonorities in a solo that could be described as career defining. His partner returns with equally furious bowing that opens new textural pathways for the violin. Before you realize it, 22 minutes have flown by. Bang later switches to kalimba on one track and Parker picks up both the shakuhachi and the stringed dousn gouni, all adding to the expanse of their dialogue. Rather than improvising the whole set, they also perform two Parker compositions. “Eternal Planet” is a flowing piece that pays tribute to the late violinist Leroy Jenkins. Unlike the rest of the set, the closing “Buddha’s Joy” builds on a steady bass vamp, showing the duo was just as comfortable inside as outside."" - Mike Shanley, Jazz Times.

Kuzu,The Glass Delusion,"""Kuzu recordings are highly instinctual and intuitional; the same can be said about any quality improv music unit. Where Kuzu makes its mark is that each of its members, Dave Rempis (saxes), Tashi Dorji (guitar) and Tyler Damon (drums), are highly individualistic musicians who play their instruments well outside the bounds of conformity. There are sounds you don’t often hear from each of these instruments and even less so as a group. Add to that their penchant for zigging when you expect them to zag, and it all adds up to adventurous and rewarding listening experience."" - S. Victor Aaron, Something Else!

Zeena Parkins / Mette Rasmussen / Ryan Sawyer,Glass Triangle,"""Parkins’ remarkable, and ever-inventive spectrum of sounds, rarely associated with a conventional harp, is at the center of the intense dynamics of this meeting. Rasmussen suggests the urgent, sharp and ecstatic edge of this trio, always pushing forward, while Sawyer adds like-minded frantic, fast-shifting and fragmented rhythmic patterns, but it is Parkins who cements the syntax of this trio, with her heavily-processed and effects-laden electric harp, but insists on a democratic, conversational interplay. Parkins cleverly crisscrosses the high-octane attacks of Rasmussen and Sawyer on the opening “Begiunners, begges, beattle, belt, believers”, sounding like a twisted electric guitar; she intensifies the mysterious, ritualist atmosphere of “Not Bygone, Just Biggone” with eerie, ambient sounds; and she anchors the nervous energy of Rasmussen and Sawyer on “Flod of Trees” with a storm of alien noises."" - Eyal Hareuveni, Free Jazz Blog",Relative Pitch,https://relativepitchrecords.bandcamp.com/album/glass-triangle,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/zeena-parkins-mette-rasmussen-ryan-sawyer-glass-triangle/s-8kicfqEkY14
Roscoe Mitchell & Mike Reed,the Ritual and the Dance,"""The album was recorded in October of 2015 as part of the Oorstof concert series in Antwerp. The piece starts with Reed weaving sparse bits of percussion around Mitchell's irregular, probing sopranino squawk. These minor sounds quickly accumulate in frequency and velocity as the musicians lock into their heady and physical interplay. Reed is a spectacular drummer, a true lion of the skins he colors his crisp, flowing percussion with subtle and sometimes unexpected sounds. Here he puts on a clinic; the speed, power, and sharpness of his technique serve to soften his pummeling attack, but it is a pummeling nevertheless. Mitchell meets him right in the midst of his tempest, a swirling mass of razorwire sound piercing the din. Reed puts down his sticks and adds some light electronics as Mitchell continues working through his concept, then returns subtly and takes over as Mitchell inhales his first deep breath in a quarter hour. The rhythm relaxes and Reed stretches out, working over his toms and punctuating the maelstrom with violent cymbal work. His pace slows and there is a brief period where the duo employ a slightly more delicate measure. Mitchell, now on alto, plays long, wailing figures against the abstract rhythms of Reed. Mitchell's playing quickens as Reed briefly recoils before going in for the finish. Now on soprano, Mitchell peels off knotty, twisted passages within the barrage. The intensity wanes for a final time and Mitchell softly plays bells against Reed's thumping backbeat and the appreciative whoops of the crowd."" - Nick Metzger, Free Jazz Blog",Astral Spirits,https://astralmitchellreed.bandcamp.com/album/the-ritual-and-the-dance,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/roscoe-mitchell-mike-reed-the-ritual-and-the-dance/s-cP7r2MtpdHM
Misha Mengelberg / Peter Brötzmann / Evan Parker / Peter Bennink / Paul Rutherford / Derek Bailey / Han Bennink,Groupcomposing,"""Comprised of a one-time international free music supergroup, originally released as the sixth production on pianist Misha Mengelberg and drummer Han Bennink's ICP label, Groupcomposing has been largely absent from the history books. This is the case because the record has been so unavailable,certainly not as a comment on the magnitude and magnificence of the music. With its Bennink cover – take that Andy Warhol! – and its two side-long tracks, it is an improvised music aficionado's treasure. Mengelberg and Bennink are joined by Bennink's brother, Peter Bennink, on alto saxophone and bagpipes (!), with an incredible reed section of Evan Parker and Peter Brötzmann, Paul Rutherford on trombone, and Derek Bailey on guitar. Moving from peaks of intensity to droning deescalation, totally improvised live in concert in 1970, Groupcomposing should be heard in the company of related records like Brötzmann's Machine Gun and Nipples, the early London Jazz Composer's Orchestra and Globe Unity Orchestra, and Manfred Schoof's European Echoes. The music is reissued here for the first time as a stand-alone CD, with original album art and an interior salon of never-published period photographs by Gérard Rouy.

Jim O'Rourke & Loren Connors,Two Nice Catholic Boys,"""Maybe it's easier to spot O'Rourke when he plays in a duo. But even then, he often fits his talents snugly inside those of his chosen partner. That was true of his first duo CD with Loren Connors, In Bern, and it's equally true of Two Nice Catholic Boys, recorded during the same 1997 European tour as In Bern. Part of the credit, of course, is due to Connors. His keen collaborative ear is as sharp as O'Rourke's, and his minimal guitar style, with its patient pace and open air, feels tailor-made for collaboration. Still, on all three pieces here, you can hear Connors' patented sound instantly, while O'Rourke's styles are slippier and sneakier, more cleverly camouflaged."" - Marc Masters, Pitchfork

I don't know if former Chicagoan Jim O'Rourke is responsible for this shift, but he's been playing with and producing records for Sakata, enlisting two American colleagues—drummer Chris Corsano and bassist Darin Gray—as his working band, Chikamorachi. On Friendly Pants (Family Vineyard), the first Sakata recording released stateside in decades, the reedist unleashes plenty of sinus-clearing torrents, but his playing also reveals a refreshing compositional logic and lyrical tenderness. O'Rourke stays behind the board, spotlighting what an effective, empathetic trio Chikamorachi has become."" - Peter Margasak, Chicago Reader.

Carol Genetti & claire rousay,Live at Elastic Arts,"""The first set brought together transgender Texan percussionist claire rousay and local vocalist Carol Genetti. While they had never played together before, each musician quickly found ways to complement the other’s approach. While past recordings indicate that rousay has ample chops as a conventional kit drummer, she currently uses two drums, some small gongs and metal bowls, and various found objects to create assemblages of perpetually changing sound. Genetti is a vocalist who has been searching out the common source where language and music converge for decades. At one point rousay echoed Genetti’s electronically distorted, back-of-the-throat rasps with slurps from her whiskey glass; at another, the friction between lullaby-like coos and scraped drum heads generated a tension that could not be denied."" - Bill Meyer, Magnet Magazine

Macie Stewart & Lia Kohl,Pocket Full of Bees,"""I think of Pocket Full of Bees as practices in approaching harmony and resonance with the self, the instrument, and one another. The similar timbres of the violin and cello further compliment each other by employing similar technique simultaneously. Both saw, radiating overtones, and Kohl’s droning propeller plane is met with Stewart’s whistling tea kettle on “Big Space Little Nothing;” Kohl and Stewart tap the strings with the bow, bow below the bridge, and strike the strings on “Toothpick Bicycle;” and the cello and violin fall into a rhythmic pluck together on “There’s Something In My Sock (It’s Good).” Like their soundings, their voicings are often similar to each other timbrally and technically, with both emitting oohs, eees, aaahs, shhhs, shrill shrieks, and purrs together. And their voicings are often similar to their soundings, with call-and-response vocalization matched with contrapuntal instrumentation or sustained bowings matched with held singing. And finally the structures seem to culminate in harmony: “Big Space Little Nothing” ends with Kohl and Stewart phasing into vocal harmony; “Toothpick Bicycle” begins with the cello and violin varying their cadences to phase in and out of harmony; and “Honey Not Sweet” sees their voicings obtain a pulsing resonance together."" - Keith Prosk, Free Jazz Blog

The score consists of 12 photos taken over an hour or so, observing the merging waters of the Rhône and the Arve rivers, the artificial wall dividing them, the earthy, blue and green colors blending. There are as many defining differences as similarities, depending on what one pays attention to but after a while the differences become apparent.

Detail (Frode Gjerstad / Johnny Dyani / John Stevens),Day Two,"""Sequenced into two LP-side sized pieces, the disc documents a classic extended example of the trio’s egalitarian ethos. Stevens never overshadows his colleagues and the communication lines remain open even when one or more of the players opts for silent listening over sound-driven input. Gjerstad opens on intentionally furtive soprano, tracing melodic figures against the massive throb of Dyani’s strings and the steady tidal tumble of Stevens’ sticks. The speed increases incrementally with tension building organically apace. There’s a stretch near the end of the first piece that dips dangerously close to longueurs where Gjerstad’s tenor appears briefly bereft of directional purpose, but his partners swiftly swoop in to shore the gap with a shared focus.

The three duos presented open with ""Sunflower,"" a piece that enters stealthily enough with barely perceptible baritone saxophone breath and minimal percussive pulse. The spell is broken by the cluck and pop of Gustafsson's saxophone and his vocalizations. Toyozumi follows with his stop-start attack which converts into a jagged blast of energy. The pair work a quiet/loud/quiet approach to great effect, drawing you in then jolting you out. ""Woman With A Cat"" finds Gustafsson hoisting both fluteophone and flute. The interaction rotates around the music's tension and release of energy, Toyozumi as tour director here. The music next presents a solo by each performer. Gustafsson returns to the baritone saxophone, applying minimalist sounds incorporating breathy passages, pops, cluck and his vocalizations. Toyozumi's solo relies on space, utilizing quiet as much as pulse here. The pair reunite for the 20+ minute ""For Ever-Advancing Artistry.""

Lindsay / Vandermark / McPhee / Sudderberg,Largest Afternoon,"""One day in the studio, something ridiculously great happened. It was deep Chicago winter, cold as shit. Four musicians assembled for a round-robin set of improvisations - duets, trios, a few quartets. Approached casually, the late morning bloomed into Largest Afternoon, 15 cracking encounters between guitarist Arto Lindsay, saxophonists Joe McPhee and Ken Vandermark, and drummer Phil Sudderberg. No expectations - open minds and creative intent. Lindsay, a brilliant singer and songwriter and one of the key architects of No Wave via his band DNA, has proven himself once again to be one of the world's top texturalists, and he is an equally sensitive and challenging group-improviser. Vandermark and McPhee brought their long friendship and musical partnership to the studio, and both engaged with Lindsay in different ways, bringing blue flame and melody. The session's final wildcard, Sudderberg, a versatile drummer who collaborates with Vandermark in the band Marker, brought a lovely sense of buoyancy and ear for contrast in colors, as well as a raucous rock pulse. WIth parts this stellar, imagine when Largest Afternoon > than the sum. Nobody knew this would happen. - Corbett vs. Dempsey
