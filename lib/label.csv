Joe McPhee,The Willisau Concert,"""Asked which of his out-of-print records he’d like to see available again, multi-instrumentalist Joe McPhee’s response was immediate: The Willisau Concert! Recorded at the Swiss festival that gave it its name in 1975, it appeared a year later as Hat Hut B, the second of the new label’s great letter series. It came packaged gorgeously in a double-gatefold with artist Klaus Baumgärtner’s stunning pen-and-ink work on the inside and out and a little hand-colored Swiss flag on the interior of each copy. Returning to the music, it’s easy to hear why McPhee holds it so dear. He’s in absolute top form on tenor and soprano saxophones, ranging from the relaxed and confident Afro-conscious feel of Nation Time to areas of more diffuse and textural investigation. John Snyder’s analog synthesizer is brilliant and hyperbolic, a surprisingly hand-in-glove match for McPhee, not dissimilar to their collaboration on the CjR release Pieces of Light. South African drummer Makaya Ntshoko is the surprise element, a guest whose sensitivity and warmth are everywhere evident, even when he kicks the energy up a notch. Along with McPhee originals, this reissue includes a never-released bonus, their take on the classic “God Bless the Child,” a total heartbreaker. The CD has been designed as a facsimile cover of the LP, respecting the beautiful and original graphic work on this classic record. Never before available in any digital form, remastered from the original tapes, The Willisau Concert is restored to its place as one of McPhee’s masterpieces."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey

Willem Breuker / Han Bennink,New Acoustic Swing Duo,"""Late in 1967, saxophonist Willem Breuker and drummer Han Bennink recorded the first LP for the new artist-run free improvised music label, ICP Records. New Acoustic Swing Duo was an instant classic, and remains one of the most enduring documents of Dutch improvised music ever recorded. With Breuker’s omnidirectional reed work, which ranges from plaintive to excoriating, occasional sneering tone adds a kind of ironic twist to the expressive outpouring. He could be as explosive as Peter Brötzmann, but Breuker has a razor sharp wit and sense of humor. Since this recording, Bennink has gone on to be seated among the royalty of jazz and improvised music drummers. At the time, he was a fresh-faced 25-year-old, hauling around increasingly immense kits with heaps of percussion flotsam and jetsam, playing tabla and vibrapan, and sparking it all with tsunami energy. Keep in mind, Coltrane and Ali had just recorded Interstellar Space (which would not be issued until 1974), and the economical drum/sax lineup was by no means yet a standard in improvised music. Shortly after recording this, Breuker and Bennink would join Brötzmann to record Machine Gun, another European free music keystone. Somehow, despite its historical importance and aesthetic magnificence, New Acoustic Swing Duo has never been available as a stand-alone CD. Remastered from original tapes, this reissue includes the original cover with the “ICP 001” hand-stamp, as well as several versions of the handmade covers designed by Bennink, drawn from Mats Gustafsson’s wonderful collection. Finally, as a special bonus, the two-disc package includes a legendary concert by Breuker and Bennink, recorded in Essen, Germany, in 1968, released here for the first time."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/new-acoustic-swing-duo,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/willem-breuker-han-bennink-new-acoustic-swing-duo/s-bK8BWiEDkxu
Paul Flaherty,Aria Nativa,"""Aria Nativa is more than Paul Flaherty's third solo saxophone album; it merges rhapsodic avant garde music, patriotic dream verse, and mortality into a frighteningly pure work of audio, visual and literary sledge. Recorded during a pair of 2007 performances, its four pieces capture lifeblood in stunning detail from foot stomps to gut hollers and crowd roars as Flaherty's free power blues dips into the well of wretchedness yet emerges with pumping fists of mirth. It's the sorta record that splays naked the artist for all: equal parts wise ass and universal vision."" - Family Vineyard.

Joe McPhee & Mats Gustafsson,Brace For Impact,"""It amazing to think that this music spent a decade on the shelf. And while music doesn't ripen like a wheel of pungent cheese, who's to say it doesn't sound a little better knowing that we may not have had the opportunity to hear it at all. The world is a much different place now than it was in 2008, and that makes looking ahead to 2028 and beyond all the more unsettling. We can only hope that someone, somewhere is cooking up a little surprise to tuck away for us until then. Something to blow away the existential dread with the sheer power of its sound. Thanks to Joe and Mats, as unintentional as it may have been I needed this music right now at this moment."" - Nick Metzger, Squidco

Zeena Parkins • Wobbly,Triplicates,"""Triplicates is a series of improvisations between Zeena Parkins, playing her singular electric harp, and Jon Leidecker, aka Wobbly, playing an instrument that generates electrical feedback. Their outputs are routed to a series of simple listening devices, machines designed to sing along with the melodies they believe themselves to be hearing, although they are often fascinatingly wrong. It quickly becomes difficult to determine the boundaries of each participant's contribution: acoustic source, electronic conductor, or triplicate."" - Relative Pitch

Josh Berman / Paul Lytton / Jason Roebke,Trio Correspondences,"""Berman’s puckered tone, fatback licks and tart smears—as ever bridging the gap between the garrulous, vocalic excursions of Ellington trumpeters like Bubber Miley and Rex Stewart and modern seekers like Wadada Leo Smith and Nate Wooley--are steadily buffeted by the rhythm section’s shifting gambits. The bassist unfurls deep, woody lines and the drummer peppers his flow with wonderfully jarring, chaotic accents, but despite the turbulence they forge an inexorable sense of forward motion, providing a platform for the cornetist to toggle masterfully between lyric flurries and knotted outbursts. Unlike the airtight miniatures on A Dance and a Hop, these pieces allow the players to resituate the same language onto a wide-open plane—pushing and pulling in changing directions and allowing spontaneous motifs to play out fully, although each musician never lets any single notion overstay it’s welcome."" - Peter Margasak

Billy Bang / William Parker,Medicine Buddha,"""Bang plays a slow, rapturous melody over an arco bass drone in the title track, before leaving Parker to his own devices. With bow in hand the bassist fuses gentle and rough sonorities in a solo that could be described as career defining. His partner returns with equally furious bowing that opens new textural pathways for the violin. Before you realize it, 22 minutes have flown by. Bang later switches to kalimba on one track and Parker picks up both the shakuhachi and the stringed dousn gouni, all adding to the expanse of their dialogue. Rather than improvising the whole set, they also perform two Parker compositions. “Eternal Planet” is a flowing piece that pays tribute to the late violinist Leroy Jenkins. Unlike the rest of the set, the closing “Buddha’s Joy” builds on a steady bass vamp, showing the duo was just as comfortable inside as outside."" - Mike Shanley, Jazz Times.

Kuzu,The Glass Delusion,"""Kuzu recordings are highly instinctual and intuitional; the same can be said about any quality improv music unit. Where Kuzu makes its mark is that each of its members, Dave Rempis (saxes), Tashi Dorji (guitar) and Tyler Damon (drums), are highly individualistic musicians who play their instruments well outside the bounds of conformity. There are sounds you don’t often hear from each of these instruments and even less so as a group. Add to that their penchant for zigging when you expect them to zag, and it all adds up to adventurous and rewarding listening experience."" - S. Victor Aaron, Something Else!

Zeena Parkins / Mette Rasmussen / Ryan Sawyer,Glass Triangle,"""Parkins’ remarkable, and ever-inventive spectrum of sounds, rarely associated with a conventional harp, is at the center of the intense dynamics of this meeting. Rasmussen suggests the urgent, sharp and ecstatic edge of this trio, always pushing forward, while Sawyer adds like-minded frantic, fast-shifting and fragmented rhythmic patterns, but it is Parkins who cements the syntax of this trio, with her heavily-processed and effects-laden electric harp, but insists on a democratic, conversational interplay. Parkins cleverly crisscrosses the high-octane attacks of Rasmussen and Sawyer on the opening “Begiunners, begges, beattle, belt, believers”, sounding like a twisted electric guitar; she intensifies the mysterious, ritualist atmosphere of “Not Bygone, Just Biggone” with eerie, ambient sounds; and she anchors the nervous energy of Rasmussen and Sawyer on “Flod of Trees” with a storm of alien noises."" - Eyal Hareuveni, Free Jazz Blog",Relative Pitch,https://relativepitchrecords.bandcamp.com/album/glass-triangle,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/zeena-parkins-mette-rasmussen-ryan-sawyer-glass-triangle/s-8kicfqEkY14
Roscoe Mitchell & Mike Reed,the Ritual and the Dance,"""The album was recorded in October of 2015 as part of the Oorstof concert series in Antwerp. The piece starts with Reed weaving sparse bits of percussion around Mitchell's irregular, probing sopranino squawk. These minor sounds quickly accumulate in frequency and velocity as the musicians lock into their heady and physical interplay. Reed is a spectacular drummer, a true lion of the skins he colors his crisp, flowing percussion with subtle and sometimes unexpected sounds. Here he puts on a clinic; the speed, power, and sharpness of his technique serve to soften his pummeling attack, but it is a pummeling nevertheless. Mitchell meets him right in the midst of his tempest, a swirling mass of razorwire sound piercing the din. Reed puts down his sticks and adds some light electronics as Mitchell continues working through his concept, then returns subtly and takes over as Mitchell inhales his first deep breath in a quarter hour. The rhythm relaxes and Reed stretches out, working over his toms and punctuating the maelstrom with violent cymbal work. His pace slows and there is a brief period where the duo employ a slightly more delicate measure. Mitchell, now on alto, plays long, wailing figures against the abstract rhythms of Reed. Mitchell's playing quickens as Reed briefly recoils before going in for the finish. Now on soprano, Mitchell peels off knotty, twisted passages within the barrage. The intensity wanes for a final time and Mitchell softly plays bells against Reed's thumping backbeat and the appreciative whoops of the crowd."" - Nick Metzger, Free Jazz Blog",Astral Spirits,https://astralmitchellreed.bandcamp.com/album/the-ritual-and-the-dance,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/roscoe-mitchell-mike-reed-the-ritual-and-the-dance/s-cP7r2MtpdHM
Misha Mengelberg / Peter Brötzmann / Evan Parker / Peter Bennink / Paul Rutherford / Derek Bailey / Han Bennink,Groupcomposing,"""Comprised of a one-time international free music supergroup, originally released as the sixth production on pianist Misha Mengelberg and drummer Han Bennink's ICP label, Groupcomposing has been largely absent from the history books. This is the case because the record has been so unavailable,certainly not as a comment on the magnitude and magnificence of the music. With its Bennink cover – take that Andy Warhol! – and its two side-long tracks, it is an improvised music aficionado's treasure. Mengelberg and Bennink are joined by Bennink's brother, Peter Bennink, on alto saxophone and bagpipes (!), with an incredible reed section of Evan Parker and Peter Brötzmann, Paul Rutherford on trombone, and Derek Bailey on guitar. Moving from peaks of intensity to droning deescalation, totally improvised live in concert in 1970, Groupcomposing should be heard in the company of related records like Brötzmann's Machine Gun and Nipples, the early London Jazz Composer's Orchestra and Globe Unity Orchestra, and Manfred Schoof's European Echoes. The music is reissued here for the first time as a stand-alone CD, with original album art and an interior salon of never-published period photographs by Gérard Rouy. The first in an ongoing series of ICP reissues on Corbett vs. Dempsey, Groupcomposing restores a classic LP to its rightful place in the canon."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/groupcomposing,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/mengelberg-brotzmann-parker-bennink-rutherford-bailey-bennink-groupcomposing/s-oD11ZBe6wKv
Jim O'Rourke & Loren Connors,Two Nice Catholic Boys,"""Maybe it's easier to spot O'Rourke when he plays in a duo. But even then, he often fits his talents snugly inside those of his chosen partner. That was true of his first duo CD with Loren Connors, In Bern, and it's equally true of Two Nice Catholic Boys, recorded during the same 1997 European tour as In Bern. Part of the credit, of course, is due to Connors. His keen collaborative ear is as sharp as O'Rourke's, and his minimal guitar style, with its patient pace and open air, feels tailor-made for collaboration. Still, on all three pieces here, you can hear Connors' patented sound instantly, while O'Rourke's styles are slippier and sneakier, more cleverly camouflaged."" - Marc Masters, Pitchfork

Akira Sakata & Chikamorachi,Live at Hungry Brain,"""But happily, in the past half-decade or so Sakata has rediscovered his focus and killer sound. I don't know if former Chicagoan Jim O'Rourke is responsible for this shift, but he's been playing with and producing records for Sakata, enlisting two American colleagues—drummer Chris Corsano and bassist Darin Gray—as his working band, Chikamorachi. On Friendly Pants (Family Vineyard), the first Sakata recording released stateside in decades, the reedist unleashes plenty of sinus-clearing torrents, but his playing also reveals a refreshing compositional logic and lyrical tenderness. O'Rourke stays behind the board, spotlighting what an effective, empathetic trio Chikamorachi has become."" - Peter Margasak, Chicago Reader.

Carol Genetti & claire rousay,Live at Elastic Arts,"""The first set brought together transgender Texan percussionist claire rousay and local vocalist Carol Genetti. While they had never played together before, each musician quickly found ways to complement the other’s approach. While past recordings indicate that rousay has ample chops as a conventional kit drummer, she currently uses two drums, some small gongs and metal bowls, and various found objects to create assemblages of perpetually changing sound. Genetti is a vocalist who has been searching out the common source where language and music converge for decades. At one point rousay echoed Genetti’s electronically distorted, back-of-the-throat rasps with slurps from her whiskey glass; at another, the friction between lullaby-like coos and scraped drum heads generated a tension that could not be denied."" - Bill Meyer, Magnet Magazine

Macie Stewart & Lia Kohl,Pocket Full of Bees,"""I think of Pocket Full of Bees as practices in approaching harmony and resonance with the self, the instrument, and one another. The similar timbres of the violin and cello further compliment each other by employing similar technique simultaneously. Both saw, radiating overtones, and Kohl’s droning propeller plane is met with Stewart’s whistling tea kettle on “Big Space Little Nothing;” Kohl and Stewart tap the strings with the bow, bow below the bridge, and strike the strings on “Toothpick Bicycle;” and the cello and violin fall into a rhythmic pluck together on “There’s Something In My Sock (It’s Good).” Like their soundings, their voicings are often similar to each other timbrally and technically, with both emitting oohs, eees, aaahs, shhhs, shrill shrieks, and purrs together. And their voicings are often similar to their soundings, with call-and-response vocalization matched with contrapuntal instrumentation or sustained bowings matched with held singing. And finally the structures seem to culminate in harmony: “Big Space Little Nothing” ends with Kohl and Stewart phasing into vocal harmony; “Toothpick Bicycle” begins with the cello and violin varying their cadences to phase in and out of harmony; and “Honey Not Sweet” sees their voicings obtain a pulsing resonance together."" - Keith Prosk, Free Jazz Blog

Magda Mayas' Filamental,Confluence,"Magda Mayas composed this piece for an octet comprised of a who's who of the avant-garde. The score consists of 12 photos taken over an hour or so, observing the merging waters of the Rhône and the Arve rivers, the artificial wall dividing them, the earthy, blue and green colors blending. There are as many defining differences as similarities, depending on what one pays attention to but after a while the differences become apparent. A variety of angles, hues, light, excerpts, focusing on one or the other river or on the in-between areas.

Detail (Frode Gjerstad / Johnny Dyani / John Stevens),Day Two,"""Sequenced into two LP-side sized pieces, the disc documents a classic extended example of the trio’s egalitarian ethos. Stevens never overshadows his colleagues and the communication lines remain open even when one or more of the players opts for silent listening over sound-driven input. Gjerstad opens on intentionally furtive soprano, tracing melodic figures against the massive throb of Dyani’s strings and the steady tidal tumble of Stevens’ sticks. The speed increases incrementally with tension building organically apace. There’s a stretch near the end of the first piece that dips dangerously close to longueurs where Gjerstad’s tenor appears briefly bereft of directional purpose, but his partners swiftly swoop in to shore the gap with a shared focus. The B-Side develops more deliberately while exuding equal heat."" - Derek Taylor, Dusted",No Business,https://nobusinessrecords.bandcamp.com/album/day-two,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/detail-gjerstad-dyani-stevens-day-two/s-BleBUP3XumR

The three duos presented open with ""Sunflower,"" a piece that enters stealthily enough with barely perceptible baritone saxophone breath and minimal percussive pulse. The spell is broken by the cluck and pop of Gustafsson's saxophone and his vocalizations. Toyozumi follows with his stop-start attack which converts into a jagged blast of energy. The pair work a quiet/loud/quiet approach to great effect, drawing you in then jolting you out. ""Woman With A Cat"" finds Gustafsson hoisting both fluteophone and flute. The interaction rotates around the music's tension and release of energy, Toyozumi as tour director here. The music next presents a solo by each performer. Gustafsson returns to the baritone saxophone, applying minimalist sounds incorporating breathy passages, pops, cluck and his vocalizations. Toyozumi's solo relies on space, utilizing quiet as much as pulse here. The pair reunite for the 20+ minute ""For Ever-Advancing Artistry."" Their music finds a meeting of the minds here, with any hesitation that might have been perceived on the previous interactions dissolved.

Lindsay / Vandermark / McPhee / Sudderberg,Largest Afternoon,"""One day in the studio, something ridiculously great happened. It was deep Chicago winter, cold as shit. Four musicians assembled for a round-robin set of improvisations - duets, trios, a few quartets. Approached casually, the late morning bloomed into Largest Afternoon, 15 cracking encounters between guitarist Arto Lindsay, saxophonists Joe McPhee and Ken Vandermark, and drummer Phil Sudderberg. No expectations - open minds and creative intent. Lindsay, a brilliant singer and songwriter and one of the key architects of No Wave via his band DNA, has proven himself once again to be one of the world's top texturalists, and he is an equally sensitive and challenging group-improviser. Vandermark and McPhee brought their long friendship and musical partnership to the studio, and both engaged with Lindsay in different ways, bringing blue flame and melody. The session's final wildcard, Sudderberg, a versatile drummer who collaborates with Vandermark in the band Marker, brought a lovely sense of buoyancy and ear for contrast in colors, as well as a raucous rock pulse.

Dudu Pukwana / Misha Mengelberg / Han Bennink ,Yi Yole,"""Recorded at the ICP Jubileum, a festival in Uithoorn, Holland, in 1978, Yi Yole brings together the core of the Instant Composers Pool – pianist Misha Mengelberg and drummer Han Bennink – with legendary South African alto saxophonist Dudu Pukwana. Longtime member of the Blue Notes, Pukwana was a beloved figure in European free music after he left South Africa in the mid-sixties and settled in London. There he worked with all of the leading lights of free improvised music, recording extensively with the Brotherhood of Breath and eventually releasing LPs under his own leadership before his untimely passing in 1990 at the age of 51. What the three tracks on Yi Yole make clear is how surprisingly well the Dutch and South African sensibilities fit together, an overall relaxed vibe leading to unforeseen directions in the music. Han Bennink ranges far beyond his drum kit and its metallic add-ons, playing trombone, clarinet, and viola; his collage design for the record, as with all ICP productions, is brilliant and perfectly matched to the music. This is the only time these three prime movers of free music would record as a trio, hitting just at the moment when the Instant Composers Pool was gaining momentum and South African jazz was growing in international stature. Released on ICP, Mengelberg/Bennink’s self-produced label, Yi Yole saw limited distribution and attention in its time, but it remains an absolute classic of improvised music, presented here in all its glory with Bennink’s design, remastered from original tapes, the box of which is reproduced on the interior spread, replete with never-seen hand notations."" - Corbett vs Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/yi-yole,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/dudu-pukwana-misha-mengelberg-han-bennink-yi-yole/s-JyorXHt0Gsp
ICP Tentet,Tetterettet,"""Recorded in 1977, the Instant Composers Pool’s Tetterettet is the first classic of the band’s larger incarnations. Assembled out of elements recorded live in Uithoorn, Utrecht, and the band’s home base of Amsterdam, with Misha Mengelberg using a cut-and-paste collage method akin to Teo Macero’swork with Miles Davis, the record features an all star lineup that added three leading lights of free music: bassist Alan Silva and saxophonists John Tchicai and Peter Brötzmann. In this period, Brötzmann made the long train trip from Wuppertal, Germany, to A’dam on a weekly basis to rehearse with ICP, bassist Silva coming in from Paris. Well known for his work in pioneer creative music ensembles such as the New York Art Quartet and the New York Contemporary Five and on John Coltrane’s Ascention, Tchicai was the Paul Desmond of free jazz, with a softer, more subtle phraseology than many of his peers. These international figures joined pianist Mengelberg and drummer Han Bennink – whose ICP co-founder Willem Breuker had broken off to form what would be come his long-time working band, the Kollektief – and their outrageous, hyper-inventive big band. Michel Waiswicz, who invented the crackle box, a user-friendly, portable electronic instrument, is a defining presence on Mengelberg’s multipart “Tetterettet,” and along with the heavyweight outta towners the band includes composer, oboist, and saxophonist Gilius Van Bergeyk, whose sequence of compositions nestle perfectly into Misha’s, Han’s gifted brother Peter Bennink on saxes, trombonist Bert Koppelaar, and cellist Tristan Honsinger, who has continued to work with the ensemble even after Misha’s death in 2017. One of the landmark records of Mengelberg tunes, with classics like “Rumboon” and “Alexander’s Marschbefehel,” Tetterettet presents a program full of musical surprises, intelligence, and ICP’s own brand of uproarious humor. A shaggy masterpiece, available here for the first time as a stand-alone CD, remastered from the original tapes, with Han Bennink’s original cover design and a contemporaneous photo from the archives of Gérard Rouy."" - Corbett vs Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/tetterettet,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/icp-tentet-tetterettet/s-boiCbVrLPXo
Misha Mengelberg / Peter Brötzmann / Evan Parker / Peter Bennink / Paul Rutherford / Derek Bailey / Han Bennink,Groupcomposing,"""Comprised of a one-time international free music supergroup, originally released as the sixth production on pianist Misha Mengelberg and drummer Han Bennink's ICP label, Groupcomposing has been largely absent from the history books. This is the case because the record has been so unavailable,certainly not as a comment on the magnitude and magnificence of the music. With its Bennink cover – take that Andy Warhol! – and its two side-long tracks, it is an improvised music aficionado's treasure. Mengelberg and Bennink are joined by Bennink's brother, Peter Bennink, on alto saxophone and bagpipes (!), with an incredible reed section of Evan Parker and Peter Brötzmann, Paul Rutherford on trombone, and Derek Bailey on guitar. Moving from peaks of intensity to droning deescalation, totally improvised live in concert in 1970, Groupcomposing should be heard in the company of related records like Brötzmann's Machine Gun and Nipples, the early London Jazz Composer's Orchestra and Globe Unity Orchestra, and Manfred Schoof's European Echoes. The music is reissued here for the first time as a stand-alone CD, with original album art and an interior salon of never-published period photographs by Gérard Rouy. The first in an ongoing series of ICP reissues on Corbett vs. Dempsey, Groupcomposing restores a classic LP to its rightful place in the canon."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/groupcomposing,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/mengelberg-brotzmann-parker-bennink-rutherford-bailey-bennink-groupcomposing/s-oD11ZBe6wKv
Willem Breuker / Han Bennink,New Acoustic Swing Duo,"""Late in 1967, saxophonist Willem Breuker and drummer Han Bennink recorded the first LP for the new artist-run free improvised music label, ICP Records. New Acoustic Swing Duo was an instant classic, and remains one of the most enduring documents of Dutch improvised music ever recorded. With Breuker’s omnidirectional reed work, which ranges from plaintive to excoriating, occasional sneering tone adds a kind of ironic twist to the expressive outpouring. He could be as explosive as Peter Brötzmann, but Breuker has a razor sharp wit and sense of humor. Since this recording, Bennink has gone on to be seated among the royalty of jazz and improvised music drummers. At the time, he was a fresh-faced 25-year-old, hauling around increasingly immense kits with heaps of percussion flotsam and jetsam, playing tabla and vibrapan, and sparking it all with tsunami energy. Keep in mind, Coltrane and Ali had just recorded Interstellar Space (which would not be issued until 1974), and the economical drum/sax lineup was by no means yet a standard in improvised music. Shortly after recording this, Breuker and Bennink would join Brötzmann to record Machine Gun, another European free music keystone. Somehow, despite its historical importance and aesthetic magnificence, New Acoustic Swing Duo has never been available as a stand-alone CD. Remastered from original tapes, this reissue includes the original cover with the “ICP 001” hand-stamp, as well as several versions of the handmade covers designed by Bennink, drawn from Mats Gustafsson’s wonderful collection. Finally, as a special bonus, the two-disc package includes a legendary concert by Breuker and Bennink, recorded in Essen, Germany, in 1968, released here for the first time."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/new-acoustic-swing-duo,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/willem-breuker-han-bennink-new-acoustic-swing-duo/s-bK8BWiEDkxu
Torbjörn Zetterberg & The Great Question,Live,"""If you’ve missed out on bassist Torbjörn Zetterberg, now’s your chance to play some catch up ball. He’s one of creative music’s most eloquent exponents, having emerged from the fertile Swedish jazz scene a little over 15 years ago. With his band Torbjörn Zetterberg Hot Five, he began a fruitful relationship with the thoroughly excellent Moserobie label, run by his frequent band mate, saxophonist Jonas Kullhammar, and by the time he was making records like Skildrar Kvinnans Kamp and Och Den Stora Frågen, we were completely hooked. Zetterberg is a Mingus for our times. He’s a composer of unusual means – great sense for how to harmonize his inventive melodies; how to make a sextet sound like a big band and how to clear space for an unaccompanied solo; his slightly devious sense of humor underlying all the drive and swing that make the best in a bass player; and best of all a respect for his musicians, who have always found ways to push his great compositions up a notch. This luminous set of tracks was recorded in performance at Stockholm’s famed Jazzclub Fasching. It presents a newly named ensemble, Torbjörn Zetterberg & The Great Question, with Kullhammar and Alberto Pinton on saxophones and clarinets, Portuguese trumpeter Susana Santos Silva, trombonist Mats Äleklint, and drummer Jon Fält. With the exception of the opening passage, which adapts the traditional “Cherry Tree Carol,” all compositions are by Zetterberg, and they make a solid case for him as a jazz writer to be taken seriously. Joyful, powerful, irreverent, and utterly fearless, The Great Question presents its case, answers the initial query, and asks more probing ones."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/live,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/torbjorn-zetterberg-the-great-question-live/s-xJy3F4xZfQn
RED trio,Suite 10 Years Anniversary,"""The Portugues RED Trio is without a doubt one of the best piano trios in Europe.  Now, four years later, we get this memorable album with the ""celebration band"", an ad hoc group of musicians, primarily also from Portugal but with the addition of some partners on the previous albums such as John Butcher and Matthias Ståhl. The other members are Sei Miguel and Luís Vicente on trumpet, Fala Mariam on trombone, Pedro Sousa and Rodrigo Amado on tenor saxophone, Nuno Torres on alto saxophone, Ernesto Rodrigues on viola, Ricardo Jacinto and Miguel Mira on cello, Carlos Santos on electronics, Miguel Abreu on voice and electric bass, and David Maranha on percussion. The performance was recorded to celebrate their tenth anniversary at the Teatro Maria Matos in February 2018. The theater itself commissioned the concert ""Suite"", a work in three acts, each written by one of the three founding members, and deliberately composed for the ensemble mentioned above."" - Stef Gijssels, Free Jazz Blog",No Business,http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/red-trio-suite-10-years-anniversary.html,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/red-trio-suite-10-years-anniversary/s-cRSYyIJAdMl
Derek Bailey / Mototeru Takagi,"Live At FarOut, Atsugi 1987","""Part of the initial group of Japanese free jazz players, Takagi ought to be far better known than he is. Starting out in percussionist Motoharu Yoshizawa’s trio in 1968, Takagi went on to play with key Japanese free improvisers like Masahiko Togashi, Masayuki Takayangi, Motoharu Yoshizawa, Itaru Oki, Toshinori Kondo and Sabu Toyozumi. From the late ‘60s on, this community of musicians began charting a collective approach to uncompromising freedom, increasingly collaborating with visiting free players from Europe and the US. Takagi was amongst those tapped when Milford Graves visited Japan in 1977 (documented on the album Meditation Among Us) and when Derek Bailey visited in 1978 (documented on the album Duo & Trio Improvisations). Bailey returned to Japan a number of times after that 1978 meeting, including the tour that resulted in this recording. When Bailey returned in 1987, he played some solos, duos with dancer Min Tanaka, and in a trio with Peter Brötzmann and percussionist Sabu Toyozumi as well as in this duo session with Takagi. The reed player sticks to soprano saxophone across the four expansive duos, a half hour opener, two 17-minute pieces, and a relatively compact 8-minute foray. Bailey’s electric guitar playing is in top form throughout, his lightning, refracted angular phrasing bursting with brittle resonance. One can readily hear why Bailey gravitated to Takagi. The reed player immediately hits with an acidic attack, starting with long tones that ring against Bailey’s harmonics, patiently building to lithe, spiky intensity. It’s always great to hear Bailey when he finds a potent foil, and the two clearly revel in the intertwined, parallel arcs that develop. Particularly over the course of the first piece, they take their time, probing, prodding, letting their respective lines course, ring against each other, unhurriedly unwind, only to lunge forth, bristling with skirling vigor, ending with Takagi looping a lyrical thread to close things out."" - Michael Rosenstein, Point of Departure",No Business,"http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/live-at-farout,-atsugi-1987-cd.html",https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/derek-bailey-mototeru-takagi-live-at-farout-atsugi-1987/s-N5eHrkj1tBi
Joe McPhee / Michael Zerang,Creole Gardens (A New Orleans Suite),"""In these recessionary times, the duet offers the optimum solution: the opportunity for dialogue and interaction, but with logistics and expense kept to a minimum. Of course, such strictures are nothing new for the avant-garde, those flowers which bloom between the cracks in the marginal wastelands. Multi-instrumentalist Joe McPhee's résumé includes more than its fair share of twosomes, with drummers forming a prominent strand. Recent partners include Hamid Drake, Paul Hession, Paal Nilssen-Love and Chris Corsano, but this encounter with Chicago-based Michael Zerang ranks among the most rewarding. It helps that both have a well of shared experience to draw upon, not least their 13 years together as integral parts of Peter Brötzmann's Chicago Tentet, and Zerang's role within McPhee's Survival Unit III trio. But it's not only about familiarity; a large degree of the success of this 60-minute live date recorded in New Orleans stems from how attuned they are to each other's intent. Zerang, in particular, probes, prods and cossets, bringing all his rhythmic acumen to bear. His easy paced tumbling cadences with their abundant pockets of space provide fertile soil in which McPhee can cultivate his patented mix of visceral abstractions and extemporized melodicism. McPhee continues to develop his use of vocalizations simultaneous with his playing. Used sparingly they pack a profound emotional kick, ranging from screams and overtones to choked cries. At the 15-minute mark in ""Congo Square Dances / Saints and Sinners,"" the saxophonist's hummed melodic line parallels a wavering whistle to invoke a touching vulnerability. At the start of the same piece, the pair illustrates a simpatico attitude to timbral exploration, the drummer accompanying McPhee's stuttering pocket trumpet with eerie moans created by dragging scrapers across his drum heads."" - John Sharpe, All About Jazz",No Business,http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/creole-gardens-(new-orleans-suite).html,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/joe-mcphee-michael-zerang-creole-gardens-a-new-orleans-suite/s-X7dOefjVGjT
Marilyn Lerner / Ken Filiano / Lou Grassi,Live at Edgefest,"""Rising On An Infrared Wave"" opens proceedings in accomplished style, co-opting silence as another member of the ensemble, to be interspersed between pellucid piano ripples, slashing arco and tinkling cymbals. Eventually the colloquy congeals first into a stop start unison, then a concerted surge. Textural interchange occupies a prominent role, especially on ""Open Cluster"" in the dialogue between Filiano's abrasive sawing and Lerner's rubbing and scraping under the bonnet, which calls to mind Agusti Fernandez' celebrated expeditions inside the piano. On ""Event Horizon"" Grassi's intro leads to swirling trio interaction, Filiano's sweet nimble fingering latterly to the fore. Once he settles into a repeated vamp, Lerner initiates an incantatory spell, fuelled by rolling drums, in what proves the highlight of this fine date."" - John Sharpe, All About Jazz",No Business,http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/edgefest-lp.html,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/marilyn-lerner-ken-filiano-lou-grassi-live-at-edgefest/s-RbgyOIwSEvR
Peter Evans / John Butcher / Clayton Thomas / Paul Lovens / Frederic Blondy,A Wing Dissolved in Light,"""Then you put on A Wing Dissolved In Light, their first album, which was recorded at the 2013 Tampere Jazz Happening, and you’re surprised: The piece starts with first-class old-school free jazz. John Butcher shines with controlled overtones, bird chirps and alienated sounds, Peter Evans gets lost in a whirlwind of eccentric tones and circular breathing on his piccolo trumpet, Lovens propels the two providing a consequent cymbal pulse, Frédéric Blondy supports Lovens with isolated Taylor chords, while Clayton Thomas’ hectic bowed bass adds fuel to the fire. But above all, A Wing Dissolved In Light is a constant twist and turn, the music is permanently moving in different directions as to sound and dynamics. It slows down and explodes, especially in the quieter parts the musicians delve into sound explorations, their different approaches blend into one great collective effort. Indeed, there are wonderful moments, for example the duo passage of Evans and Thomas, who are joined by the others at an incredible speed, the almost classic piano trio part, and Evans’ and Butcher’s squeaking and gargling dialogue which prepares the ground for a tender and melancholic break. Here and there the music is reminiscent of an extended version of the Schlippenbach Trio because of Paul Lovens’ subtle control of things and John Butcher’s saxophone, which is sometimes close to Evan Parker’s style. A Wing Dissolved In Light is a very delightful and fascinating album for fans of both European improvised music of the 1970s and those who are interested in disregarding the apparent limitations of the instruments used in this band. It’s been one of my favorites in 2017 so far."" - Martin Schray, Free Jazz Blog",No Business,http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/anemone-a-wing-dissolved-in-light.html,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/evans-butcher-thomas-lovens-blondy-a-wing-dissolved-in-light/s-Uklduh9q7vt
Jeremiah Cymerman / Charlie Looker,A Horizon Made Of Canvas,"""A Horizon Made of Canvas is a bleak marvel, a journey through the creeping sensation that something new and unexplainable is around the corner. Sharing its name with the first chapter of a book by neo-reactionary writer Mencius Moldbug, the album presents sounds like a fog: dense yet sparse, seemingly unmovable and yet always in motion, a contradictory mass whose insides are empty. I felt nervous while listening to it, a strange bodily alert that was telling me I was somehow about to fall; A Horizon draws full attention through its slight, quiet tone and subtle instrumental dialogues, like a dread mystery unfolding, making it easy to lose oneself amidst the volumes spoken by its silences. It made me want to know where it was taking me, the clarinet’s voice a jeweled allure leading only deeper inside the fog, every step a nudge in paranoiac impulses – in the end, the place where it was taking me was simply nowhere."" - A Closer Listen",Astral Spirits,https://horizonmadeofcanvas.bandcamp.com/album/a-horizon-made-of-canvas,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/jeremiah-cymerman-charlie-looker-a-horizon-made-of-canvas/s-ma4JFlvAkcC
"Charles Rumback w/ Jim Baker, James Singleton & Greg Ward",Cadillac Turns,"""If you’d have asked Charles Rumback a couple of years ago what his next album would be like, he might have responded that it would be a lot like his last two. That is, the drummer leading his working trio with Jim Baker on piano and Greg Ward on sax, running through a set of fresh new Rumback compositions. But fate had other plans. At the urging of couple of musician friends, bassist James Singleton was added to the trio at the last minute for a planned performance at the 2017 Instigation Festival and family life precluded the intended introduction of new Rumback tunes; the newly expanded band was left recycling some of his old ones. Those live performances are preserved for the new Charles Rumback album that actually happened, Cadillac Turns. But first, a word about this late addition. James Singleton is the Ray Brown of New Orleans, the bassist who can be found on more meaningful sessions on recordings from NOLA – or heavily connected to it — than anyone else. His list of credits stretch from Irma Thomas and James Booker to Anders Osbourne and Rickie Lee Jones, and he’s a key member of New Orleans’ premier modern jazz combo, Astral Project. Of late, he’s appeared in the progressive jazz supergroup Nolatet."" S.

Charles Rumback w/ Jim Baker & John Tate,June Holiday,"""June Holiday is the group’s least aggressive, but the leader frequently builds in an exquisite sense of tension, pitting surface placidity against rumbling anxiety. All three musicians contribute tunes here, and most of them convey a distinct ballad-like feel. The tunefulness comes in spare, single-note tangles: Overtones hang in the air only to be juddered by spasmodic clusters of cymbals and toms, summoning something far more meaningful than an unabashed love song or a freak-out. Baker has been a key fixture on the Chicago scene for decades and June Holiday arguably could stand as his most impressive performance on a recording. His opening “Foglights” is suitably hazy, with Rumback’s sensitive, shuffling brushwork underlining a Herbie Nichols vibe, while the darting, broken-glass figures the pianist brings to “Huh?” evoke the sound of early Cecil Taylor—an off-kilter but unapologetic sense of swing pushing even the most abstract phrases forward."" - Peter Margasak, Downbeat",Astral Spirits,https://cadillacturns.bandcamp.com/album/june-holiday,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/charles-rumback-w-jim-baker-john-tate-june-holiday/s-kzkgajTzRlI
Roscoe Mitchell & Mike Reed,the Ritual and the Dance,"""The album was recorded in October of 2015 as part of the Oorstof concert series in Antwerp. The piece starts with Reed weaving sparse bits of percussion around Mitchell's irregular, probing sopranino squawk. These minor sounds quickly accumulate in frequency and velocity as the musicians lock into their heady and physical interplay. Reed is a spectacular drummer, a true lion of the skins he colors his crisp, flowing percussion with subtle and sometimes unexpected sounds. Here he puts on a clinic; the speed, power, and sharpness of his technique serve to soften his pummeling attack, but it is a pummeling nevertheless. Mitchell meets him right in the midst of his tempest, a swirling mass of razorwire sound piercing the din. Reed puts down his sticks and adds some light electronics as Mitchell continues working through his concept, then returns subtly and takes over as Mitchell inhales his first deep breath in a quarter hour. The rhythm relaxes and Reed stretches out, working over his toms and punctuating the maelstrom with violent cymbal work. His pace slows and there is a brief period where the duo employ a slightly more delicate measure. Mitchell, now on alto, plays long, wailing figures against the abstract rhythms of Reed. Mitchell's playing quickens as Reed briefly recoils before going in for the finish. Now on soprano, Mitchell peels off knotty, twisted passages within the barrage. The intensity wanes for a final time and Mitchell softly plays bells against Reed's thumping backbeat and the appreciative whoops of the crowd."" - Nick Metzger, Free Jazz Blog",Astral Spirits,https://astralmitchellreed.bandcamp.com/album/the-ritual-and-the-dance,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/roscoe-mitchell-mike-reed-the-ritual-and-the-dance/s-cP7r2MtpdHM

Signe Emmeluth,Hi Hello I’m Signe,"""Danish saxophonist Signe Emmeluth, who now lives in Oslo after studying in Trondheim, Norway, has made a strong impact on the European free music scene in the last couple of years, not only due to her ferocious sound, but also through a stylistic openness. Her rugged band Amoeba fulfils her compositional interests, while her duo with guitarist Karl Bjorå, Owl, which released a stunning 2020 debut called Mille Feuille, is more spare and contemplative. This solo outing — a single piece recorded live for Ingebrit Håker Flaten’s Sonic Transmissions Festival — contains its fair share of fire-breathing, with tart boppish phrases ricocheting toward the horizon in upper register sallies, but it opens and closes with finely etched restraint, as sibilant, snaking lines build and recede from and into nothingness.

Hali Palombo,Cylinder Loops,"""Hali Palombo’s Cylinder Loops is the first release of 2021 on Astral Editions and upon first glance it may look like a minor one: 12 loops clocking in at 18 minutes. Yet, I’ve been sitting with the loops for a month now and it might be the next keystone release for defining the label’s sound.  Palombo’s 2019 and 2020 works have been tinkering with shortwave radio ghosts and fragments; Cherry Ripe practically summons dispatches from the bomb shelters of the atomic era. Sometimes mournful or monolithic, yet with an undercurrent of warmth and bittersweetness to this era. On Cylinder Loops, Palombo takes a dozen fragments (courtesy of UCSB’s Cylinder Archive), highlighting the ghosts in those auditory fragments. Palombo’s loops will be quite familiar should you have a sweet tooth for Lelyand Kirby and Ghost Box (there lies a hauntology tag at the bottom of its bandcamp page). The cylinder loops have a wicked sense of space they conjure up. Demented carnivals (Loop 8), funeral liturgy (Loop 4), or flickering nitrate print (Loop 3) all provide images of a pre-WWI society on the fringe of a modernity it will soon be crushed under. Palombo then bends that sense of temporality; often pushing the sounds of these loops towards dispatches from futures akin to the dream worlds of Tim Hecker’s Harmony in Ultraviolet (Loop 6/9). The entire affair is precise, not a moment wasted. As a result, it lends itself both to trips across the midwest as much as a rainy morning lost in a foggy haze. You’ll best want to pick this one up before it fades away."" - Matty McPherson, Tabs Out",Astral Editions,https://aecylinderloops.bandcamp.com/album/cylinder-loops,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/hali-palombo-cylinder-loops/s-yOYu1wH7xR5

Montgomery & Turner,Sounds Passing Through Circumstances,"""‘Drifting’ is the word I keep coming back to as I sail through Jayve Montgomery and Nick Turner’s Sounds Passing Through Circumstances. Duets for mellotron and flute and saxophone (with effects) that are weightless under starlit night skies as you watch your frozen breath float into the crisp, cold air. Montgomery and Turner are in tune with the harmony of the spheres. Each side-long piece gets deep into meditative hinterlands where thoughts turn inward. Emerald mists from Turner’s mellotron shroud Montgomery’s distant star gazing, his effects-laden flute growing into a web of light. Repetition wields a soft sword on “Circumstance 01,” with flickering, faint percussive elements providing the guideposts as the duo intertwines layers of cosmic, reverb-soaked sound. Montgomery takes off into the cosmos on “Circumstance 02,” piercing through the synthetic aural haze with passages of moving, reflective notes. Sequences of time fall into eternity as you lose yourself to the enveloping sonic stream of consciousness. Sounds Passing Through Circumstances is music for inner reflection.

Anáhuac,Y_y,"""This trio, composed of Juan García (double bass), Ignaz Schick (turntable, sampler, electronics) and Chris Cogburn (electronic, percussion), has been using non-idiomatic improvisation since 2016 to propose a new way in which the audience can approach the concept of sound as an art form. That this album bears the word “ascua” (ember) as its title is quite appropriate, since both of its tracks seem to grow as more elements are thrown into them, just as if it were a sonic wood fire; there’s a hissing, static effect that persists throughout the album -like that of a dusty vinyl record- that effectively emulates the sound of something being slowly consumed by a small fire (as we can appreciate on “scoria”) or it might as well represent a liquid reaching its boiling point, as illustrated on “sudar” climax. This time, however, Anáhuac has found a way to use less elements, and the results are far more great, as every nuance and texture is more noticeable; this helps create a deeper sense of immersion. Each member’s contributions are minimal, but vital. This is not a demonstration of virtuosity or manual dexterity, nor it is a relentless attack on the senses: the purpose is not to trace complex melodic or harmonic contours, nor the careful and methodical confection of typical rhythmic patterns, but a fusion in favor of texture and the exploration of the timbral possibilities each element involved has to offer, while maintaining a sense of balance and direction."" - Densidad25
