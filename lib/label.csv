"Masahiko Satoh, Otomo Yoshihide & Roger Turner",Sea,"The Sea Trio—comprising legendary pianist Masahiko Satoh, influential guitarist/multi-instrumentalist Otomo Yoshihide, and master percussionist Roger Turner—first met and played at the legendary Egg Farm just outside Tokyo. Their chemistry was immediate, but they felt the confines of a recording studio limited their improvisational possibilities. Shortly after they booked a show at Tokyo hotspot Pit-Inn and found the electricity in the air of the packed club was the perfect environment for their roiling exchange. Attempting to capture the energy of that evening in a recording is a bit like trying to catch lightning in a bottle; Sea is the surprisingly effective vessel of that effort.",Relative Pitch,https://relativepitchrecords.bandcamp.com/album/sea,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/sea/s-6isuu4xa7hV?si=6214d7c10be4471b82e0151ace2bcf76
Michel Doneda & Lê Quan Ninh,Thirty Ways To Avoid Talking,"Soprano player Michel Doneda and Le Quan Ninh are celebrating a 30 year playing relationship. Doneda's playing can be at turns lyrical, playful, or raucous, and can switch from the liveliness of street melodies to circular breathing, microscopic sounds, or shrieking outbursts. Ninh plays regularly in ensembles in forms that mix improvised acoustic & electroacoustic music, 'performance art', dance, poetry, experimental cinema, photography and video. Listening is their main discipline. ""It’s our discipline. To listen to everything and maybe to enjoy in a way, but not necessarily, it’s about appreciating. Just to have this presence of so many qualities of sounds, because there is always something happening.""",Relative Pitch,https://relativepitchrecords.bandcamp.com/album/thirty-ways-to-avoid-talking,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/thirty-ways-to-avoid-talking/s-JaVaHLeuMHl?si=f651e2a634f0431dae3e257c934f0f19

Matthew Lux Communication Arts Quartet,Contra / Fact,"""Given his history, it's remarkable that the new Contra/Fact release is Lux's first album under his own name—it's billed to Matthew Lux's Communication Arts Quartet. Even though he's clearly privileged working as an ensemble member over pushing a musical agenda of his own, you'd think he would've gotten around to a project of his own sooner. His band on Contra/Fact includes drummer Mikel Patrick Avery, cornetist Ben Lamar Gay, and reedist Jayve Montgomery, all of whom add percussion or electronics to their main instrumental contribution. The album covers lots of terrain, including post-Miles Davis electric grooves (the sultry ""C.G.L.W.""), hypnotic, probing space voyages (""Colonial Gysins""), shape-shifting modal adventures (""Israels'""), and post-swing ballads (""Gris/Bleu,"" which Lux built from Lester Young's earthy solo on his legendary 1957 performance of ""Fine and Mellow"" for the TV show The Sound of Jazz). Even when the music pushes into the abstract (""Mercury Lights""), it continues to emphasize a strong, thick pulse. Below you can check out another smoky ballad, ""Ninna Nanna."" - Peter Margasak, Chicago Reader

Hearts & Minds,Electroradiance,"""Stein's woody sound with funk, rock, electronics, and free jazz. Opening with a swampy synth-bass line, Giallorenzo then adds an electric piano dance around Taylor's pulse, all in service of Stein's aeronautics. Taylor who replaced now ex-pat Frank Rosaly in the trio, is well versed in these affairs, having powered various Chicago Underground ensembles with Rob Mazurek and more recently Jaimie Branch's Fly Or Die and the tremendous duo with James Brandon Lewis. He doesn't shy aways from dance and rock beats, muscling the pulse on ""Step'n"" with an additional pulse from Giallorenzo, who marches in step with Stein, before the composition transitions into some bebop. If you're thinking Sun Ra, you'd be correct. The title track comes straight from El Saturn Research laboratories with scorched circuits and blips, as the members skate the very edges of their instruments. In a blink of an eye (or did a millennia pass?) ""Shreveport"" evolves into a Promethean New Orleans march accented with a deep bass line, and the simple melody bleeds into a continuous outward path."" - Mark Corroto, All About Jazz

Brandon Seabrook w/Cooper Moore & Gerald Cleaver,Exultatins,"""Like the music, the recording is bigger than life, almost cinematic. Check out the deeply earthy “Absurdities in Bondage” to hear just how deep and wide a rhythm section can come across in recorded technicolor, due in no small part to Cooper-Moore’s whoops and slides as the diddley-bow takes on a humanity of its own. Thudding, crashing through the false boundaries of history, progress and construct, each cycle delineated by what it would be tasteless merely to call a snare pop, Seabrook’s dense harmonies make the whole edifice float. His guitarwork throughout is unlike any I’ve heard. Sure, you can trace everything from Red-era King Crimson to Ornette Coleman and Pat Metheny’s groundbreaking Song X as the music rips, swings and liquefies along its chosen trails, but no allusion can address its simultaneous density and surprising clarity, not to mention the harmonic syntax that seems to be Seabrook’s own. It’s thorny, it’s exciting, and it’s unique, and that’s quite a combination for a trio format that could easily have warn out its welcome with the first track. Seabrook proves himself to be one of the most creative guitarists around, and the trio is a unit with which to reckon."" - Marc Medwin, Dusted Magazine.

Their collective imagination and speed of response betrays no age-related dampening of the firing neurons. Momentary connections, which vouchsafe intent, listening and shared purpose, illuminate the dense organic flow.

DUX Orchestra,duck walks dog (with mixed results),"""The cover of the 1994 archival recording Duck Walks Dog (With Mixed Results) by the DUX Orchestra presents an intriguing line up which combines American free jazzers with Swedish baritone saxophonist Mats Gustafsson. Even within the New York City contingent there is diversity, as veteran stickman Walter Perkins (who played with Sonny Rollins, Roland Kirk and Charles Mingus among many others) rubs shoulders with young drummer Susie Ibarra (in her pre-David S. Ware days), stalwart reedmen Dave Sewelson and Will Connell Jr, and bassist Dave Hofstra, the last four all members of bassist William Parker's Little Huey Creative Music Orchestra at the time. Then there is the little-known guitarist jc morrison (who styles himself all lower case). And it's actually morrison who is key to this session, as a visit to his website divulges. At the time, DUX was an informal grouping around the guitarist, Sewelson, Perkins and Parker, which could expand to include others, as it did to meet morrison's orchestral ambitions on this occasion. Although only seven strong, the outfit offers a full, if bottom heavy, palette and takes a widescreen approach to marshalling the resources on hand, courtesy of loose arrangements by morrison and Sewelson."" - John Sharpe, All About Jazz

Now, four years later, we get this memorable album with the ""celebration band"", an ad hoc group of musicians, primarily also from Portugal but with the addition of some partners on the previous albums such as John Butcher and Matthias Ståhl.

The performance was recorded to celebrate their tenth anniversary at the Teatro Maria Matos in February 2018.

Derek Bailey / Mototeru Takagi,"Live At FarOut, Atsugi 1987","""Part of the initial group of Japanese free jazz players, Takagi ought to be far better known than he is. Starting out in percussionist Motoharu Yoshizawa’s trio in 1968, Takagi went on to play with key Japanese free improvisers like Masahiko Togashi, Masayuki Takayangi, Motoharu Yoshizawa, Itaru Oki, Toshinori Kondo and Sabu Toyozumi. From the late ‘60s on, this community of musicians began charting a collective approach to uncompromising freedom, increasingly collaborating with visiting free players from Europe and the US. Takagi was amongst those tapped when Milford Graves visited Japan in 1977 (documented on the album Meditation Among Us) and when Derek Bailey visited in 1978 (documented on the album Duo & Trio Improvisations). Bailey returned to Japan a number of times after that 1978 meeting, including the tour that resulted in this recording. When Bailey returned in 1987, he played some solos, duos with dancer Min Tanaka, and in a trio with Peter Brötzmann and percussionist Sabu Toyozumi as well as in this duo session with Takagi. The reed player sticks to soprano saxophone across the four expansive duos, a half hour opener, two 17-minute pieces, and a relatively compact 8-minute foray. Bailey’s electric guitar playing is in top form throughout, his lightning, refracted angular phrasing bursting with brittle resonance. One can readily hear why Bailey gravitated to Takagi. The reed player immediately hits with an acidic attack, starting with long tones that ring against Bailey’s harmonics, patiently building to lithe, spiky intensity. It’s always great to hear Bailey when he finds a potent foil, and the two clearly revel in the intertwined, parallel arcs that develop. Particularly over the course of the first piece, they take their time, probing, prodding, letting their respective lines course, ring against each other, unhurriedly unwind, only to lunge forth, bristling with skirling vigor, ending with Takagi looping a lyrical thread to close things out."" - Michael Rosenstein, Point of Departure",No Business,"http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/live-at-farout,-atsugi-1987-cd.html",https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/derek-bailey-mototeru-takagi-live-at-farout-atsugi-1987/s-N5eHrkj1tBi
Joe McPhee / Michael Zerang,Creole Gardens (A New Orleans Suite),"""In these recessionary times, the duet offers the optimum solution: the opportunity for dialogue and interaction, but with logistics and expense kept to a minimum. Of course, such strictures are nothing new for the avant-garde, those flowers which bloom between the cracks in the marginal wastelands. Multi-instrumentalist Joe McPhee's résumé includes more than its fair share of twosomes, with drummers forming a prominent strand. Recent partners include Hamid Drake, Paul Hession, Paal Nilssen-Love and Chris Corsano, but this encounter with Chicago-based Michael Zerang ranks among the most rewarding. It helps that both have a well of shared experience to draw upon, not least their 13 years together as integral parts of Peter Brötzmann's Chicago Tentet, and Zerang's role within McPhee's Survival Unit III trio. But it's not only about familiarity; a large degree of the success of this 60-minute live date recorded in New Orleans stems from how attuned they are to each other's intent. Zerang, in particular, probes, prods and cossets, bringing all his rhythmic acumen to bear. His easy paced tumbling cadences with their abundant pockets of space provide fertile soil in which McPhee can cultivate his patented mix of visceral abstractions and extemporized melodicism. McPhee continues to develop his use of vocalizations simultaneous with his playing. Used sparingly they pack a profound emotional kick, ranging from screams and overtones to choked cries. At the 15-minute mark in ""Congo Square Dances / Saints and Sinners,"" the saxophonist's hummed melodic line parallels a wavering whistle to invoke a touching vulnerability. At the start of the same piece, the pair illustrates a simpatico attitude to timbral exploration, the drummer accompanying McPhee's stuttering pocket trumpet with eerie moans created by dragging scrapers across his drum heads."" - John Sharpe, All About Jazz",No Business,http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/creole-gardens-(new-orleans-suite).html,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/joe-mcphee-michael-zerang-creole-gardens-a-new-orleans-suite/s-X7dOefjVGjT
Marilyn Lerner / Ken Filiano / Lou Grassi,Live at Edgefest,"""Rising On An Infrared Wave"" opens proceedings in accomplished style, co-opting silence as another member of the ensemble, to be interspersed between pellucid piano ripples, slashing arco and tinkling cymbals. Eventually the colloquy congeals first into a stop start unison, then a concerted surge. Textural interchange occupies a prominent role, especially on ""Open Cluster"" in the dialogue between Filiano's abrasive sawing and Lerner's rubbing and scraping under the bonnet, which calls to mind Agusti Fernandez' celebrated expeditions inside the piano. On ""Event Horizon"" Grassi's intro leads to swirling trio interaction, Filiano's sweet nimble fingering latterly to the fore. Once he settles into a repeated vamp, Lerner initiates an incantatory spell, fuelled by rolling drums, in what proves the highlight of this fine date."" - John Sharpe, All About Jazz",No Business,http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/edgefest-lp.html,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/marilyn-lerner-ken-filiano-lou-grassi-live-at-edgefest/s-RbgyOIwSEvR
Peter Evans / John Butcher / Clayton Thomas / Paul Lovens / Frederic Blondy,A Wing Dissolved in Light,"""Then you put on A Wing Dissolved In Light, their first album, which was recorded at the 2013 Tampere Jazz Happening, and you’re surprised: The piece starts with first-class old-school free jazz. John Butcher shines with controlled overtones, bird chirps and alienated sounds, Peter Evans gets lost in a whirlwind of eccentric tones and circular breathing on his piccolo trumpet, Lovens propels the two providing a consequent cymbal pulse, Frédéric Blondy supports Lovens with isolated Taylor chords, while Clayton Thomas’ hectic bowed bass adds fuel to the fire. But above all, A Wing Dissolved In Light is a constant twist and turn, the music is permanently moving in different directions as to sound and dynamics. It slows down and explodes, especially in the quieter parts the musicians delve into sound explorations, their different approaches blend into one great collective effort. Indeed, there are wonderful moments, for example the duo passage of Evans and Thomas, who are joined by the others at an incredible speed, the almost classic piano trio part, and Evans’ and Butcher’s squeaking and gargling dialogue which prepares the ground for a tender and melancholic break. Here and there the music is reminiscent of an extended version of the Schlippenbach Trio because of Paul Lovens’ subtle control of things and John Butcher’s saxophone, which is sometimes close to Evan Parker’s style. A Wing Dissolved In Light is a very delightful and fascinating album for fans of both European improvised music of the 1970s and those who are interested in disregarding the apparent limitations of the instruments used in this band. It’s been one of my favorites in 2017 so far."" - Martin Schray, Free Jazz Blog",No Business,http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/anemone-a-wing-dissolved-in-light.html,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/evans-butcher-thomas-lovens-blondy-a-wing-dissolved-in-light/s-Uklduh9q7vt
Joe McPhee,Alone Together: The Solo Ensemble Recordings 1974 & 1979,"""In his upstate NY secret laboratory, home-based in Poughkeepsie, Joe McPhee diligently documented his activities throughout the '70s, with the help of Craig Johnson, the producer who started CjR as an outlet for McPhee's music. Among the unreleased tapes waxed in that span, Alone Together is unique and especially beautiful. Like Sound on Sound (released by Corbett vs. Dempsey in 2010), these recordings make use of multitrack recording, overdubbing McPhee upon McPhee, however where those earlier recordings had an experimental tendency, the Alone Together tracks were more compositional in nature, allowing the multi-instrumentalist to build and sculpt each piece, creating complete wind ensembles one track at a time. In 1974 and then again in a longer session in 1979, McPhee recorded in concise solo, duo, and trio contexts, and in more extensive brass and reed quartets – all McPhee, all the time. Going head-to-head with the best of the saxophone foursomes of the era, McPhee is a one-man-WSQ, his probing investigations and lyrical statements as incisive and insightful as those of his best-known recordings."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey

"Threadbare (Jason Stein, Ben Cruz, Emerson Hunt)",Silver Dollar,"""Their debut album, Silver Dollar, is technically free jazz; but as the album unfolds, it’s easy to hear a strong affinity for ‘70s rock bands like Led Zeppelin, and jazz-rock hybrids like the Mahavishnu Orchestra and Soft Machine. The songs begin delicately, often with one instrument, and gather steam as they go, rising to volcanic crescendos before settling into dense, mesmerizing grooves. On “Threadbare,” in particular, Stein opens the track by seemingly blowing into the clarinet without a reed which, when combined with Hunton’s irregular drum pattern and Cruz’s eerie guitar chords, generates feelings of pending doom. At the four-minute mark, the instrumentalists fall into a Latin rhythm that never quite syncs up; but the track thrives even if the timing is slightly off. Compare that with “24 Mesh Veils” and “Funny Thing Is”: Neither song really takes shape at all. The former slowly trudges along, carried by its murky mix of clarinet and guitar.

Mockūnas / Sakata / Yoshihide / Umezu / Koketsu / Hayashi,Luidas Mockūnas In Residency at Bitches Brew,"""Bitches Brew is the club, not the sound of the music – a night spot in Yokohama where European reedman Liudas Mockunas improvised these performances in the company of a range of different Japanese players! The lineup shifts with each track, as do the horns handled by Mockunas – who blows tenor and soprano sax – plus a very cool ""water prepared soprano sax"" – in the company of Akira Sakata on clarinet and alto, Masayo Koketsu on alto, Eiichi Hayashi on alto, Yoshihide Otomo on guitar, and Kazutoki Umezu on bass clarinet, alto, and soprano! All tracks are nice and long, and filled with the sort of sharp reed interplay you'd know from both the music of Mockunas or Sakata – on titles that include ""Brown Line"", ""Green Line"", ""Red Line"", ""Blue Line"", and ""Yellow Line"" - Dusty Groove",No Business,https://nobusinessrecords.bandcamp.com/album/liudas-mock-nas-in-residency-at-bitches-brew,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/mockunas-sakata-yoshihide-umezu-koketsu-hayashi-in-residency-at-bitches-brew/s-QEVPFZiUCnv
Andrew Lamb / Tom Abbs / Michael Wimberly / Guillermo E. Brown,Rhapsody in Black,"""The music of Rhapsody in Black has a distinctive character: it speaks of gentleness, humility, artfulness and dignified cultural embrace. Sax and flute player, Baba Andrew Lamb wastes no time in manifesting the aforementioned qualities in the opening page of the liner notes. The title of the album addresses a celebration of Black Heritage. The first percussion sounds heard are unavoidably spare and soft, but “initiate” (cf. the title of the first track,“Initiation”) a series of beautifully executed discrete strokes on the bass strings by Lamb's decade long collaborator Tom Abbs. The atmosphere built is environmental, say of the jungle, bearing some kind of tribal significance, haunting yells as testimony. Lambs’ clarinet induces an unique sound aura of calling forth spiritual power that pervades the entire album. The bass creates strong arco and pizzicato voices within the group throughout the recording and seems just as prominent instrumentally as the reeds are. Abbs also sputters and rips short glissandos through the tuba to change up the bass colors. But Lamb sings the most intricate songs; he repeats a phrase, rarely arpeggiates and sculpts sturdy and erect melodies, most often in the same gesture on any instrument he plays whether it is the clarinet, the tenor, metal or wooden flute. The percussionists, Michael Wimberly and Guillermo E. Brown, are integral to the group’s musical process. Lamb describes the percussionists' interaction: ""They play together at the same time or accompany each other taking turns."" The drummers commit to holding up the rhythmic content with undying and varying persistence: with light-handedness on cymbals, snare, woodblocks or bells. The pair keeps the music tight, manages its direction and seals its reverence."" --2012 Lyn Horton ",No Business,https://nobusinessrecords.bandcamp.com/album/rhapsody-in-black,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/andrew-lamb-rhapsody-in-black/s-Mgd1sgdP7wV
Detail (Frode Gjerstad / Johnny Dyani / John Stevens),Day Two,"""Sequenced into two LP-side sized pieces, the disc documents a classic extended example of the trio’s egalitarian ethos. Stevens never overshadows his colleagues and the communication lines remain open even when one or more of the players opts for silent listening over sound-driven input. Gjerstad opens on intentionally furtive soprano, tracing melodic figures against the massive throb of Dyani’s strings and the steady tidal tumble of Stevens’ sticks. The speed increases incrementally with tension building organically apace. There’s a stretch near the end of the first piece that dips dangerously close to longueurs where Gjerstad’s tenor appears briefly bereft of directional purpose, but his partners swiftly swoop in to shore the gap with a shared focus. The B-Side develops more deliberately while exuding equal heat."" - Derek Taylor, Dusted",No Business,https://nobusinessrecords.bandcamp.com/album/day-two,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/detail-gjerstad-dyani-stevens-day-two/s-BleBUP3XumR
Sabu Toyozumi / Mats Gustafsson,Hokusai,"""Hokusai is available in LP with three lengthy tracks or CD with the inclusion of an additional solo performance by Gustafsson and Toyozumi. The three duos presented open with ""Sunflower,"" a piece that enters stealthily enough with barely perceptible baritone saxophone breath and minimal percussive pulse. The spell is broken by the cluck and pop of Gustafsson's saxophone and his vocalizations. Toyozumi follows with his stop-start attack which converts into a jagged blast of energy. The pair work a quiet/loud/quiet approach to great effect, drawing you in then jolting you out. ""Woman With A Cat"" finds Gustafsson hoisting both fluteophone and flute. The interaction rotates around the music's tension and release of energy, Toyozumi as tour director here. The music next presents a solo by each performer. Gustafsson returns to the baritone saxophone, applying minimalist sounds incorporating breathy passages, pops, cluck and his vocalizations. Toyozumi's solo relies on space, utilizing quiet as much as pulse here. The pair reunite for the 20+ minute ""For Ever-Advancing Artistry."" Their music finds a meeting of the minds here, with any hesitation that might have been perceived on the previous interactions dissolved.

Magda Mayas' Filamental,Confluence,"Magda Mayas composed this piece for an octet comprised of a who's who of the avant-garde. The score consists of 12 photos taken over an hour or so, observing the merging waters of the Rhône and the Arve rivers, the artificial wall dividing them, the earthy, blue and green colors blending. There are as many defining differences as similarities, depending on what one pays attention to but after a while the differences become apparent. A variety of angles, hues, light, excerpts, focusing on one or the other river or on the in-between areas.

Joe McPhee,The Willisau Concert,"""Asked which of his out-of-print records he’d like to see available again, multi-instrumentalist Joe McPhee’s response was immediate: The Willisau Concert! Recorded at the Swiss festival that gave it its name in 1975, it appeared a year later as Hat Hut B, the second of the new label’s great letter series. It came packaged gorgeously in a double-gatefold with artist Klaus Baumgärtner’s stunning pen-and-ink work on the inside and out and a little hand-colored Swiss flag on the interior of each copy. Returning to the music, it’s easy to hear why McPhee holds it so dear. He’s in absolute top form on tenor and soprano saxophones, ranging from the relaxed and confident Afro-conscious feel of Nation Time to areas of more diffuse and textural investigation. John Snyder’s analog synthesizer is brilliant and hyperbolic, a surprisingly hand-in-glove match for McPhee, not dissimilar to their collaboration on the CjR release Pieces of Light. South African drummer Makaya Ntshoko is the surprise element, a guest whose sensitivity and warmth are everywhere evident, even when he kicks the energy up a notch. Along with McPhee originals, this reissue includes a never-released bonus, their take on the classic “God Bless the Child,” a total heartbreaker. The CD has been designed as a facsimile cover of the LP, respecting the beautiful and original graphic work on this classic record. Never before available in any digital form, remastered from the original tapes, The Willisau Concert is restored to its place as one of McPhee’s masterpieces."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey

Willem Breuker / Han Bennink,New Acoustic Swing Duo,"""Late in 1967, saxophonist Willem Breuker and drummer Han Bennink recorded the first LP for the new artist-run free improvised music label, ICP Records. New Acoustic Swing Duo was an instant classic, and remains one of the most enduring documents of Dutch improvised music ever recorded. With Breuker’s omnidirectional reed work, which ranges from plaintive to excoriating, occasional sneering tone adds a kind of ironic twist to the expressive outpouring. He could be as explosive as Peter Brötzmann, but Breuker has a razor sharp wit and sense of humor. Since this recording, Bennink has gone on to be seated among the royalty of jazz and improvised music drummers. At the time, he was a fresh-faced 25-year-old, hauling around increasingly immense kits with heaps of percussion flotsam and jetsam, playing tabla and vibrapan, and sparking it all with tsunami energy. Keep in mind, Coltrane and Ali had just recorded Interstellar Space (which would not be issued until 1974), and the economical drum/sax lineup was by no means yet a standard in improvised music. Shortly after recording this, Breuker and Bennink would join Brötzmann to record Machine Gun, another European free music keystone. Somehow, despite its historical importance and aesthetic magnificence, New Acoustic Swing Duo has never been available as a stand-alone CD. Remastered from original tapes, this reissue includes the original cover with the “ICP 001” hand-stamp, as well as several versions of the handmade covers designed by Bennink, drawn from Mats Gustafsson’s wonderful collection. Finally, as a special bonus, the two-disc package includes a legendary concert by Breuker and Bennink, recorded in Essen, Germany, in 1968, released here for the first time."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/new-acoustic-swing-duo,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/willem-breuker-han-bennink-new-acoustic-swing-duo/s-bK8BWiEDkxu
Paul Flaherty,Aria Nativa,"""Aria Nativa is more than Paul Flaherty's third solo saxophone album; it merges rhapsodic avant garde music, patriotic dream verse, and mortality into a frighteningly pure work of audio, visual and literary sledge. Recorded during a pair of 2007 performances, its four pieces capture lifeblood in stunning detail from foot stomps to gut hollers and crowd roars as Flaherty's free power blues dips into the well of wretchedness yet emerges with pumping fists of mirth. It's the sorta record that splays naked the artist for all: equal parts wise ass and universal vision."" - Family Vineyard.

And while music doesn't ripen like a wheel of pungent cheese, who's to say it doesn't sound a little better knowing that we may not have had the opportunity to hear it at all. The world is a much different place now than it was in 2008, and that makes looking ahead to 2028 and beyond all the more unsettling. We can only hope that someone, somewhere is cooking up a little surprise to tuck away for us until then. Something to blow away the existential dread with the sheer power of its sound.

Zeena Parkins • Wobbly,Triplicates,"""Triplicates is a series of improvisations between Zeena Parkins, playing her singular electric harp, and Jon Leidecker, aka Wobbly, playing an instrument that generates electrical feedback. Their outputs are routed to a series of simple listening devices, machines designed to sing along with the melodies they believe themselves to be hearing, although they are often fascinatingly wrong.

Josh Berman / Paul Lytton / Jason Roebke,Trio Correspondences,"""Berman’s puckered tone, fatback licks and tart smears—as ever bridging the gap between the garrulous, vocalic excursions of Ellington trumpeters like Bubber Miley and Rex Stewart and modern seekers like Wadada Leo Smith and Nate Wooley--are steadily buffeted by the rhythm section’s shifting gambits. The bassist unfurls deep, woody lines and the drummer peppers his flow with wonderfully jarring, chaotic accents, but despite the turbulence they forge an inexorable sense of forward motion, providing a platform for the cornetist to toggle masterfully between lyric flurries and knotted outbursts. Unlike the airtight miniatures on A Dance and a Hop, these pieces allow the players to resituate the same language onto a wide-open plane—pushing and pulling in changing directions and allowing spontaneous motifs to play out fully, although each musician never lets any single notion overstay it’s welcome."" - Peter Margasak

Wadada Leo Smith / Douglas R. Ewart / Mike Reed,Sun Beans of Shimmering Light,"""The album’s opener, “Constellations And Conjunctional Spaces” sets the tone; Smith and Ewart’s playing melds seamlessly, while Reed’s flourishes add tasteful rhythmic and tonal accents. On “Super Moon Rising,” Smith’s bright tone and Reed’s playing are particularly impressive, providing a dynamic and ever-shifting bed of percussion for Smith and Ewart to play both in and around. “Unknown Forces” begins by showcasing Smith’s strength as a soloist. Smith’s lines are soulful and patiently phrased, jutting out between each daring moment of silence. On Sun Beans of Shimmering Light, these experienced players carry on a legacy of experimental music and boundless creativity that started so many decades ago. That Smith continues to present music from the very cutting edge of jazz and improvised music after so many years of challenging the genre’s conventions is an impressive and inspiring feat.

Chris Williams & Patrick Shiroishi,Sans Soleil,"...but more importantly Sans Soleil comes across less as a trumpet/saxophone duo album and more in line with the sounds of Art Ensemble of Chicago or other forward thinking ""sound"" ensembles.  Synthesizers, glockenspeil and many other objects interject as foreground and background sounds through the entirety of the album. Coming in at over 60 minutes (including the digital bonus track) there is a lot of music to digest here on Sans Soleil, and that might be the best part of all.

[Ahmed],Nights on Saturn (communication),"""The music does have a hypnotic appeal, particularly when all four musicians succumb fully to the piece's over-the-top mania. Even the most hair-raising moments of Super Majnoon don't reach the volcanic amplitude on display here. The live setting enhances the effect, and the crowd's enthusiastic responses are well-captured throughout the recording. While some listeners may desire a bit more dynamic contrast, or occasionally tire of the essentially iterative quality of the music, there is a fascinating aspect to hearing Wright and Thomas explore and interrogate the figures they conjure—at times seemingly trying to beat them into submission—while seeking even more ecstatic heights. For its sheer cathartic power, Nights on Saturn is indeed an accomplishment.""

Kuzu,The Glass Delusion,"""Kuzu recordings are highly instinctual and intuitional; the same can be said about any quality improv music unit. Where Kuzu makes its mark is that each of its members, Dave Rempis (saxes), Tashi Dorji (guitar) and Tyler Damon (drums), are highly individualistic musicians who play their instruments well outside the bounds of conformity. There are sounds you don’t often hear from each of these instruments and even less so as a group. Add to that their penchant for zigging when you expect them to zag, and it all adds up to adventurous and rewarding listening experience."" - S. Victor Aaron, Something Else!

Michael Foster & Ben Bennett,Contractions,"""The intimate yet stormy duet feature both Foster and Bennett all over their instruments, pushing themselves and their instruments sonic ranges into the most extreme terrains. Foster talks and shouts through the saxes mouthpieces and often uses his instruments as percussive instruments in addition to his strong rhythmic articulation while Bennett blows on his membranes as if there were reeds instruments. Both have developed such a close affinity that they can shift the level of intensity and energy within a second or instantly alternate between a muscular, roaring blow-out and an abstract, almost silent sonic searches. There is a sense of thematic development to Foster and Bennett performance as both communicate a kind of story full of hair-raising adventures and wild twists that demands a certain showmanship. No doubt, these two hard-working improvisers know how to keep their audience alert and attentive."" - Eyal Hareuveni, Salt Peanuts",Astral Spirits,https://fosterbennett.bandcamp.com/album/contractions-2,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/michael-foster-ben-bennett-contractions/s-Rjp06xPHbFW
Amirtha Kidambi & Matteo Liberatore,Neutral Love,"""This time, we’re shifting across to Twitter so The Wire editor Derek Walmsley can make a recommendation – ‘Neutral Love’ by Amirtha Kidambi & Matteo Liberatore. Derek writes, “I absolutely love this” and I can understand why. It’s absolutely enveloping, gorgeous, strung out with dissonance and texture and a silence all the more eloquent for the occasional disruption and distortion. Or, Avant Music News puts it, “Kidambi eschews singing for drones, mouth and throat noises, and plaintive tones, unbending in her lack of orthodoxy. Liberatore provides his own drones as well as long-held notes and dissonant chords on an undistorted electric guitar.

Landon Caldwell & Nick Yeck-Stauffer,Unity in Isolation,"""And what I’m feeling right now in an immense drifting sensation, lost in the trance of Landon Caldwell’s organ drone and synthesizer keys; it’s a deviously simple ambient core you can imagine. Completely ruling side A, the seventeen minute suite, “Ugly Connection,” finds Nick Yeck-Stuaffer swirling through the ambience with his otherworldly pocket trumpet blasts. The two Crazy Doberman members had some of the most notable moments on Illusory Expansion from last year — in fact, I’m quite certain Staffer’s trumpet is the opening note! Here though, they really chew the scenery and spread out like the ocean floor. Caldwell’s hypnotic keys try to stay locked into a reverent melody as Stauffer’s trumpet playing reaches its most punchdrunk at the suite’s climax.

Gryphon Rue & Merche Blasco,North of the Future,"The shimmering Super Tender introduces us to North Of The Future’s entrancing sound worlds, equal parts elegy, experiment, and sonic prism capturing 2020’s wake. North Of The Future is a homebound duet between Rue and Blasco with instrumental interlocutors. The scarcely governable voice of Blasco’s EMS Synthi AKS (“Cintia”) and her singing saw entangle signals with Rue’s singing saw, harmonium, and custom modular synths (“Fritz”). A rare model from 1972, Cintia’s frayed circuitry gives the synth a special character – she interjects, digresses, changes the conversation. Ffffffffffff. Zeeeeerrrrt. Pft Pfa Pfta. At times in the music Cintia’s temperament is directly invoked: the comedic squeals which burst forth from the droning opening chords of Cintia On Fritz were elicited by rolling an orange up and down Cintia’s conductive keyboard.

Based on the strength of this wild performance, the meeting of these astoundingly creative minds was severely overdue. Throughout the record, the group creates highly-textured seas of tense and feral sound, often bordering on the atonal.

Mac Blackout,Love Profess,"""An album that starts with the sort of free jazz that feels at least familiar, things move quickly beyond ""Wandering Spheres"" and into other territory entirely. ""Forever"" finds Mac using sax and faint keyboard samples to craft something nearly ambient, but thoroughly unsettling, while ""Magic Hour 2020"", with vocal samples from a younger Mac Blackout, is more Fad Gadget than John Coltrane. Elsewhere, ""Revolutionary Tide"" uses horn honks to punctuate a ruminative exploration of electronica, while the lovely clsoer ""Dear Mom"" reminded me of an Underworld number, or something from Eno. Love Profess is going to get hyped as a jazz record and that's unfortunate. It's really something else entirely, and it's likely going to disappoint anyone looking for jazz. That said, it's sure to inspire anyone who's looking for something bravely iconoclastic.

The Active mix is suited to listening while doing, and the Passive mix is intended for devoted attention to inner reality. The theory of brainwave entrainment suggests that through sustained listening brain activity will adapt to the rate of beating binaural frequencies. Huizkol gradually raises this rate to an energetic centerpiece before returning to an ultimately relaxed state.

The Berwyn musician became known for his hypnotic compositions as a member of late-70s synth collective VCSR, and after the band split in the early 80s, Vermette began self-releasing solo work on his own Rainforest Productions label, starting with 1984’s Katha Visions (reissued in 2013 by the Galactic Archive label run by Reader contributor Steve Krakow, in conjunction with Permanent Records). Vermette’s sound is rooted in the music of pioneering electronic groups such as Tangerine Dream and Cluster, and on Hunting for Planet 9 he continues on his galaxy quest with melodic, gently celestial tracks such as “Saturn’s Rings” and “Kuiper Belt.” The album begins with the ominous “Space #8,” whose loud, dissonant patchwork of sound feels like it could propel you to the darkest corners of the Milky Way—and then the next track, “Surface of Titania,” arrives with a gentle bounce to return you to the comforts of the solar system. With its playful variety of spacy dynamics, Hunting for Planet 9 is a welcome voyage through electronic sound that will clear your head for takeoff."" - Salem Collo-Julin, Chicago Reader",Trouble in Mind,https://bilvermette.bandcamp.com/album/hunting-for-planet-9,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/bil-vermette-hunting-for-planet-9/s-MwBRmTYAWIA
FACS,Present Tense,"Chicago trio FACS never stop pushing forward; they’ve honed and refined their stark, minimal scrape and clatter for four years and counting, having risen out of the ashes of beloved Chicago band Disappears in 2018 with the bone-rattling intensity of Negative Houses. After three albums in the past three years, the trio return in 2021 with Present Tense, their fourth album and perhaps their sharpest statement as a band. Opener “XOUT” barrels forward like a tank, with Case’s guitar chiming like warning bells, until the climax comes crashing down, glitching out near the close. “Strawberry Cough” comes next, its fusion of corporeal playing and stately, electronic heartbeats punctured by random bursts of noise or backwards masked sounds. “Alone Without”, a track originally recorded for Adult Swim’s 2020 singles series appears next, albeit in different form; more menacing and serpentine. Side two opens with “General Public”, taking the loud/quiet dynamic as a jumping off point for the song’s unsettling seasick vibe. ‘How To See In the Dark” offers a brief respite, with its persistent, dark quietude that lingers until the song’s end. “Present Tense”, the album’s title track, offers up its first truly weird moment mid-song when the song changes mood distinctly, and the music drops out save for Case’s guitar and vocals. The album’s final track, the densely packed “Mirrored”, begins with a restrained, post-rock shuffle. The mind-scrambling cacophony that comes next takes its time to roll in, but once it does, it comes in waves, flipping back onto itself multiple times until it’s folded into oblivion.

Mountain Movers,World What World,"Mountain Movers arguably are the perfect band for all the true “heads” out there. The New Haven quartet have been at it for 15 years, and the “newest” lineup (now at it for well over a decade; vocalist/guitarist Dan Greene, bassist Rick Omonte, guitarist Kryssi Battalene and drummer Ross Menze) have firmly grasped what it takes to fry brains; achingly beautiful melodies buoyed by a life raft of white-hot guitar scree and mind-melting feedback. “World What World” is the band’s eighth album and third for Trouble In Mind Records.",Trouble in Mind,https://themountainmovers.bandcamp.com/album/world-what-world,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/mountain-movers-world-what-world/s-xeiUgdGTHFK
