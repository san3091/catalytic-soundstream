Ben Bennett / Zoots Houston / Fred Lonberg-Holm,Pinkie No,"""Notice Recordings’ Chicago origins were heavily galvanized by regularly seeing sets by cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm and multi-instrumental improviser Zoots Houston. Both have since separately relocated to Kingston, NY, where they continue to engage with the kinds of musical exchanges exemplified here. This set, recorded live at Chicago’s Elastic Arts, finds them performing with percussionist Ben Bennett. Bennett, a musician and performance artist, is a notable figure in the current and vibrant free improv and jazz scene in NYC; recent collaborations include Michael Foster and Jack Wright, among others. All three players metaphorically deconstruct their instruments while scattering pockets of agitated hot air on the performance floor, augmented with pedals, radioesque static sweeps, tightly propelled breaths, and extended techniques. This is dry, heavily structural, bristling stuff, with periodic digressions into melody and a strong control of focused and at times uncomfortably magnified timbres. Much of the material is urgent and electronic, filling the space and remaining firmly gestural. These two sidelong sets display slices of time coming from strong voices within this niche of contemporary improvisation."" - Notice Recordings

Sarah Hennies & Greg Stuart,Rundle,"""Sarah Hennies and Greg Stuart have both primarily been known as percussionists, and although Hennies has lately been exploring more performance art and conceptual modes of expression, their work on Rundle reminds us of their strong voices within minimal improvisation. Subtly employing a broad palette of expertly recorded sounds, they move through a series of aural events and sequences of beguiling complexity. Also working as two-thirds of the trio Meridian, Hennies and Stuart share a strong sense of direction, making deeply assured choices that move in and out of narrative and coherence without betraying dynamic limits. The pair create distinctive and purposeful music that pushes against the boundaries of contemporary minimal performance."" - Notice Recordings

Jason Kahn & Tim Olive,Fukuoka / Osaka,"""Kahn and Olive both demonstrate exceptional attention to unrecognized sounds (see Kahn's ongoing Unheard Cities project), and one of the unique attributes of these pieces is their ability to make sounds whose sources, even with limited tools, aren't quite placeable. Their sound palette occasionally finds tension between understood words and speech as sound: hearing a sound that may or may not be speech, and speech that may or may not be understandable. They possess a unique resourcefulness on this release that makes it a surprising listen."" - Notice Recordings

Dudu Pukwana / Misha Mengelberg / Han Bennink ,Yi Yole,"""Recorded at the ICP Jubileum, a festival in Uithoorn, Holland, in 1978, Yi Yole brings together the core of the Instant Composers Pool – pianist Misha Mengelberg and drummer Han Bennink – with legendary South African alto saxophonist Dudu Pukwana. Longtime member of the Blue Notes, Pukwana was a beloved figure in European free music after he left South Africa in the mid-sixties and settled in London. There he worked with all of the leading lights of free improvised music, recording extensively with the Brotherhood of Breath and eventually releasing LPs under his own leadership before his untimely passing in 1990 at the age of 51. What the three tracks on Yi Yole make clear is how surprisingly well the Dutch and South African sensibilities fit together, an overall relaxed vibe leading to unforeseen directions in the music. Han Bennink ranges far beyond his drum kit and its metallic add-ons, playing trombone, clarinet, and viola; his collage design for the record, as with all ICP productions, is brilliant and perfectly matched to the music. This is the only time these three prime movers of free music would record as a trio, hitting just at the moment when the Instant Composers Pool was gaining momentum and South African jazz was growing in international stature. Released on ICP, Mengelberg/Bennink’s self-produced label, Yi Yole saw limited distribution and attention in its time, but it remains an absolute classic of improvised music, presented here in all its glory with Bennink’s design, remastered from original tapes, the box of which is reproduced on the interior spread, replete with never-seen hand notations."" - Corbett vs Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/yi-yole,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/dudu-pukwana-misha-mengelberg-han-bennink-yi-yole/s-JyorXHt0Gsp
ICP Tentet,Tetterettet,"""Recorded in 1977, the Instant Composers Pool’s Tetterettet is the first classic of the band’s larger incarnations. Assembled out of elements recorded live in Uithoorn, Utrecht, and the band’s home base of Amsterdam, with Misha Mengelberg using a cut-and-paste collage method akin to Teo Macero’swork with Miles Davis, the record features an all star lineup that added three leading lights of free music: bassist Alan Silva and saxophonists John Tchicai and Peter Brötzmann. In this period, Brötzmann made the long train trip from Wuppertal, Germany, to A’dam on a weekly basis to rehearse with ICP, bassist Silva coming in from Paris. Well known for his work in pioneer creative music ensembles such as the New York Art Quartet and the New York Contemporary Five and on John Coltrane’s Ascention, Tchicai was the Paul Desmond of free jazz, with a softer, more subtle phraseology than many of his peers. These international figures joined pianist Mengelberg and drummer Han Bennink – whose ICP co-founder Willem Breuker had broken off to form what would be come his long-time working band, the Kollektief – and their outrageous, hyper-inventive big band. Michel Waiswicz, who invented the crackle box, a user-friendly, portable electronic instrument, is a defining presence on Mengelberg’s multipart “Tetterettet,” and along with the heavyweight outta towners the band includes composer, oboist, and saxophonist Gilius Van Bergeyk, whose sequence of compositions nestle perfectly into Misha’s, Han’s gifted brother Peter Bennink on saxes, trombonist Bert Koppelaar, and cellist Tristan Honsinger, who has continued to work with the ensemble even after Misha’s death in 2017. One of the landmark records of Mengelberg tunes, with classics like “Rumboon” and “Alexander’s Marschbefehel,” Tetterettet presents a program full of musical surprises, intelligence, and ICP’s own brand of uproarious humor. A shaggy masterpiece, available here for the first time as a stand-alone CD, remastered from the original tapes, with Han Bennink’s original cover design and a contemporaneous photo from the archives of Gérard Rouy."" - Corbett vs Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/tetterettet,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/icp-tentet-tetterettet/s-boiCbVrLPXo
Misha Mengelberg / Peter Brötzmann / Evan Parker / Peter Bennink / Paul Rutherford / Derek Bailey / Han Bennink,Groupcomposing,"""Comprised of a one-time international free music supergroup, originally released as the sixth production on pianist Misha Mengelberg and drummer Han Bennink's ICP label, Groupcomposing has been largely absent from the history books. This is the case because the record has been so unavailable,certainly not as a comment on the magnitude and magnificence of the music. With its Bennink cover – take that Andy Warhol! – and its two side-long tracks, it is an improvised music aficionado's treasure. Mengelberg and Bennink are joined by Bennink's brother, Peter Bennink, on alto saxophone and bagpipes (!), with an incredible reed section of Evan Parker and Peter Brötzmann, Paul Rutherford on trombone, and Derek Bailey on guitar. Moving from peaks of intensity to droning deescalation, totally improvised live in concert in 1970, Groupcomposing should be heard in the company of related records like Brötzmann's Machine Gun and Nipples, the early London Jazz Composer's Orchestra and Globe Unity Orchestra, and Manfred Schoof's European Echoes. The music is reissued here for the first time as a stand-alone CD, with original album art and an interior salon of never-published period photographs by Gérard Rouy. The first in an ongoing series of ICP reissues on Corbett vs. Dempsey, Groupcomposing restores a classic LP to its rightful place in the canon."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/groupcomposing,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/mengelberg-brotzmann-parker-bennink-rutherford-bailey-bennink-groupcomposing/s-oD11ZBe6wKv
Willem Breuker / Han Bennink,New Acoustic Swing Duo,"""Late in 1967, saxophonist Willem Breuker and drummer Han Bennink recorded the first LP for the new artist-run free improvised music label, ICP Records. New Acoustic Swing Duo was an instant classic, and remains one of the most enduring documents of Dutch improvised music ever recorded. With Breuker’s omnidirectional reed work, which ranges from plaintive to excoriating, occasional sneering tone adds a kind of ironic twist to the expressive outpouring. He could be as explosive as Peter Brötzmann, but Breuker has a razor sharp wit and sense of humor. Since this recording, Bennink has gone on to be seated among the royalty of jazz and improvised music drummers. At the time, he was a fresh-faced 25-year-old, hauling around increasingly immense kits with heaps of percussion flotsam and jetsam, playing tabla and vibrapan, and sparking it all with tsunami energy. Keep in mind, Coltrane and Ali had just recorded Interstellar Space (which would not be issued until 1974), and the economical drum/sax lineup was by no means yet a standard in improvised music. Shortly after recording this, Breuker and Bennink would join Brötzmann to record Machine Gun, another European free music keystone. Somehow, despite its historical importance and aesthetic magnificence, New Acoustic Swing Duo has never been available as a stand-alone CD. Remastered from original tapes, this reissue includes the original cover with the “ICP 001” hand-stamp, as well as several versions of the handmade covers designed by Bennink, drawn from Mats Gustafsson’s wonderful collection. Finally, as a special bonus, the two-disc package includes a legendary concert by Breuker and Bennink, recorded in Essen, Germany, in 1968, released here for the first time."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/new-acoustic-swing-duo,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/willem-breuker-han-bennink-new-acoustic-swing-duo/s-bK8BWiEDkxu
Torbjörn Zetterberg & The Great Question,Live,"""If you’ve missed out on bassist Torbjörn Zetterberg, now’s your chance to play some catch up ball. He’s one of creative music’s most eloquent exponents, having emerged from the fertile Swedish jazz scene a little over 15 years ago. With his band Torbjörn Zetterberg Hot Five, he began a fruitful relationship with the thoroughly excellent Moserobie label, run by his frequent band mate, saxophonist Jonas Kullhammar, and by the time he was making records like Skildrar Kvinnans Kamp and Och Den Stora Frågen, we were completely hooked. Zetterberg is a Mingus for our times. He’s a composer of unusual means – great sense for how to harmonize his inventive melodies; how to make a sextet sound like a big band and how to clear space for an unaccompanied solo; his slightly devious sense of humor underlying all the drive and swing that make the best in a bass player; and best of all a respect for his musicians, who have always found ways to push his great compositions up a notch. This luminous set of tracks was recorded in performance at Stockholm’s famed Jazzclub Fasching. It presents a newly named ensemble, Torbjörn Zetterberg & The Great Question, with Kullhammar and Alberto Pinton on saxophones and clarinets, Portuguese trumpeter Susana Santos Silva, trombonist Mats Äleklint, and drummer Jon Fält. With the exception of the opening passage, which adapts the traditional “Cherry Tree Carol,” all compositions are by Zetterberg, and they make a solid case for him as a jazz writer to be taken seriously. Joyful, powerful, irreverent, and utterly fearless, The Great Question presents its case, answers the initial query, and asks more probing ones."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/live,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/torbjorn-zetterberg-the-great-question-live/s-xJy3F4xZfQn
RED trio,Suite 10 Years Anniversary,"""The Portugues RED Trio is without a doubt one of the best piano trios in Europe.  Now, four years later, we get this memorable album with the ""celebration band"", an ad hoc group of musicians, primarily also from Portugal but with the addition of some partners on the previous albums such as John Butcher and Matthias Ståhl. The other members are Sei Miguel and Luís Vicente on trumpet, Fala Mariam on trombone, Pedro Sousa and Rodrigo Amado on tenor saxophone, Nuno Torres on alto saxophone, Ernesto Rodrigues on viola, Ricardo Jacinto and Miguel Mira on cello, Carlos Santos on electronics, Miguel Abreu on voice and electric bass, and David Maranha on percussion. The performance was recorded to celebrate their tenth anniversary at the Teatro Maria Matos in February 2018. The theater itself commissioned the concert ""Suite"", a work in three acts, each written by one of the three founding members, and deliberately composed for the ensemble mentioned above."" - Stef Gijssels, Free Jazz Blog",No Business,http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/red-trio-suite-10-years-anniversary.html,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/red-trio-suite-10-years-anniversary/s-cRSYyIJAdMl
Derek Bailey / Mototeru Takagi,"Live At FarOut, Atsugi 1987","""Part of the initial group of Japanese free jazz players, Takagi ought to be far better known than he is. Starting out in percussionist Motoharu Yoshizawa’s trio in 1968, Takagi went on to play with key Japanese free improvisers like Masahiko Togashi, Masayuki Takayangi, Motoharu Yoshizawa, Itaru Oki, Toshinori Kondo and Sabu Toyozumi. From the late ‘60s on, this community of musicians began charting a collective approach to uncompromising freedom, increasingly collaborating with visiting free players from Europe and the US. Takagi was amongst those tapped when Milford Graves visited Japan in 1977 (documented on the album Meditation Among Us) and when Derek Bailey visited in 1978 (documented on the album Duo & Trio Improvisations). Bailey returned to Japan a number of times after that 1978 meeting, including the tour that resulted in this recording. When Bailey returned in 1987, he played some solos, duos with dancer Min Tanaka, and in a trio with Peter Brötzmann and percussionist Sabu Toyozumi as well as in this duo session with Takagi. The reed player sticks to soprano saxophone across the four expansive duos, a half hour opener, two 17-minute pieces, and a relatively compact 8-minute foray. Bailey’s electric guitar playing is in top form throughout, his lightning, refracted angular phrasing bursting with brittle resonance. One can readily hear why Bailey gravitated to Takagi. The reed player immediately hits with an acidic attack, starting with long tones that ring against Bailey’s harmonics, patiently building to lithe, spiky intensity. It’s always great to hear Bailey when he finds a potent foil, and the two clearly revel in the intertwined, parallel arcs that develop. Particularly over the course of the first piece, they take their time, probing, prodding, letting their respective lines course, ring against each other, unhurriedly unwind, only to lunge forth, bristling with skirling vigor, ending with Takagi looping a lyrical thread to close things out."" - Michael Rosenstein, Point of Departure",No Business,"http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/live-at-farout,-atsugi-1987-cd.html",https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/derek-bailey-mototeru-takagi-live-at-farout-atsugi-1987/s-N5eHrkj1tBi
Joe McPhee / Michael Zerang,Creole Gardens (A New Orleans Suite),"""In these recessionary times, the duet offers the optimum solution: the opportunity for dialogue and interaction, but with logistics and expense kept to a minimum. Of course, such strictures are nothing new for the avant-garde, those flowers which bloom between the cracks in the marginal wastelands. Multi-instrumentalist Joe McPhee's résumé includes more than its fair share of twosomes, with drummers forming a prominent strand. Recent partners include Hamid Drake, Paul Hession, Paal Nilssen-Love and Chris Corsano, but this encounter with Chicago-based Michael Zerang ranks among the most rewarding. It helps that both have a well of shared experience to draw upon, not least their 13 years together as integral parts of Peter Brötzmann's Chicago Tentet, and Zerang's role within McPhee's Survival Unit III trio. But it's not only about familiarity; a large degree of the success of this 60-minute live date recorded in New Orleans stems from how attuned they are to each other's intent. Zerang, in particular, probes, prods and cossets, bringing all his rhythmic acumen to bear. His easy paced tumbling cadences with their abundant pockets of space provide fertile soil in which McPhee can cultivate his patented mix of visceral abstractions and extemporized melodicism. McPhee continues to develop his use of vocalizations simultaneous with his playing. Used sparingly they pack a profound emotional kick, ranging from screams and overtones to choked cries. At the 15-minute mark in ""Congo Square Dances / Saints and Sinners,"" the saxophonist's hummed melodic line parallels a wavering whistle to invoke a touching vulnerability. At the start of the same piece, the pair illustrates a simpatico attitude to timbral exploration, the drummer accompanying McPhee's stuttering pocket trumpet with eerie moans created by dragging scrapers across his drum heads."" - John Sharpe, All About Jazz",No Business,http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/creole-gardens-(new-orleans-suite).html,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/joe-mcphee-michael-zerang-creole-gardens-a-new-orleans-suite/s-X7dOefjVGjT
Marilyn Lerner / Ken Filiano / Lou Grassi,Live at Edgefest,"""Rising On An Infrared Wave"" opens proceedings in accomplished style, co-opting silence as another member of the ensemble, to be interspersed between pellucid piano ripples, slashing arco and tinkling cymbals. Eventually the colloquy congeals first into a stop start unison, then a concerted surge. Textural interchange occupies a prominent role, especially on ""Open Cluster"" in the dialogue between Filiano's abrasive sawing and Lerner's rubbing and scraping under the bonnet, which calls to mind Agusti Fernandez' celebrated expeditions inside the piano. On ""Event Horizon"" Grassi's intro leads to swirling trio interaction, Filiano's sweet nimble fingering latterly to the fore. Once he settles into a repeated vamp, Lerner initiates an incantatory spell, fuelled by rolling drums, in what proves the highlight of this fine date."" - John Sharpe, All About Jazz",No Business,http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/edgefest-lp.html,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/marilyn-lerner-ken-filiano-lou-grassi-live-at-edgefest/s-RbgyOIwSEvR
Peter Evans / John Butcher / Clayton Thomas / Paul Lovens / Frederic Blondy,A Wing Dissolved in Light,"""Then you put on A Wing Dissolved In Light, their first album, which was recorded at the 2013 Tampere Jazz Happening, and you’re surprised: The piece starts with first-class old-school free jazz. John Butcher shines with controlled overtones, bird chirps and alienated sounds, Peter Evans gets lost in a whirlwind of eccentric tones and circular breathing on his piccolo trumpet, Lovens propels the two providing a consequent cymbal pulse, Frédéric Blondy supports Lovens with isolated Taylor chords, while Clayton Thomas’ hectic bowed bass adds fuel to the fire. But above all, A Wing Dissolved In Light is a constant twist and turn, the music is permanently moving in different directions as to sound and dynamics. It slows down and explodes, especially in the quieter parts the musicians delve into sound explorations, their different approaches blend into one great collective effort. Indeed, there are wonderful moments, for example the duo passage of Evans and Thomas, who are joined by the others at an incredible speed, the almost classic piano trio part, and Evans’ and Butcher’s squeaking and gargling dialogue which prepares the ground for a tender and melancholic break. Here and there the music is reminiscent of an extended version of the Schlippenbach Trio because of Paul Lovens’ subtle control of things and John Butcher’s saxophone, which is sometimes close to Evan Parker’s style. A Wing Dissolved In Light is a very delightful and fascinating album for fans of both European improvised music of the 1970s and those who are interested in disregarding the apparent limitations of the instruments used in this band. It’s been one of my favorites in 2017 so far."" - Martin Schray, Free Jazz Blog",No Business,http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/anemone-a-wing-dissolved-in-light.html,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/evans-butcher-thomas-lovens-blondy-a-wing-dissolved-in-light/s-Uklduh9q7vt
Jeremiah Cymerman / Charlie Looker,A Horizon Made Of Canvas,"""A Horizon Made of Canvas is a bleak marvel, a journey through the creeping sensation that something new and unexplainable is around the corner. Sharing its name with the first chapter of a book by neo-reactionary writer Mencius Moldbug, the album presents sounds like a fog: dense yet sparse, seemingly unmovable and yet always in motion, a contradictory mass whose insides are empty. I felt nervous while listening to it, a strange bodily alert that was telling me I was somehow about to fall; A Horizon draws full attention through its slight, quiet tone and subtle instrumental dialogues, like a dread mystery unfolding, making it easy to lose oneself amidst the volumes spoken by its silences. It made me want to know where it was taking me, the clarinet’s voice a jeweled allure leading only deeper inside the fog, every step a nudge in paranoiac impulses – in the end, the place where it was taking me was simply nowhere."" - A Closer Listen",Astral Spirits,https://horizonmadeofcanvas.bandcamp.com/album/a-horizon-made-of-canvas,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/jeremiah-cymerman-charlie-looker-a-horizon-made-of-canvas/s-ma4JFlvAkcC
"Charles Rumback w/ Jim Baker, James Singleton & Greg Ward",Cadillac Turns,"""If you’d have asked Charles Rumback a couple of years ago what his next album would be like, he might have responded that it would be a lot like his last two. That is, the drummer leading his working trio with Jim Baker on piano and Greg Ward on sax, running through a set of fresh new Rumback compositions. But fate had other plans. At the urging of couple of musician friends, bassist James Singleton was added to the trio at the last minute for a planned performance at the 2017 Instigation Festival and family life precluded the intended introduction of new Rumback tunes; the newly expanded band was left recycling some of his old ones. Those live performances are preserved for the new Charles Rumback album that actually happened, Cadillac Turns. But first, a word about this late addition. James Singleton is the Ray Brown of New Orleans, the bassist who can be found on more meaningful sessions on recordings from NOLA – or heavily connected to it — than anyone else. His list of credits stretch from Irma Thomas and James Booker to Anders Osbourne and Rickie Lee Jones, and he’s a key member of New Orleans’ premier modern jazz combo, Astral Project. Of late, he’s appeared in the progressive jazz supergroup Nolatet."" S.

Charles Rumback w/ Jim Baker & John Tate,June Holiday,"""June Holiday is the group’s least aggressive, but the leader frequently builds in an exquisite sense of tension, pitting surface placidity against rumbling anxiety. All three musicians contribute tunes here, and most of them convey a distinct ballad-like feel. The tunefulness comes in spare, single-note tangles: Overtones hang in the air only to be juddered by spasmodic clusters of cymbals and toms, summoning something far more meaningful than an unabashed love song or a freak-out. Baker has been a key fixture on the Chicago scene for decades and June Holiday arguably could stand as his most impressive performance on a recording. His opening “Foglights” is suitably hazy, with Rumback’s sensitive, shuffling brushwork underlining a Herbie Nichols vibe, while the darting, broken-glass figures the pianist brings to “Huh?” evoke the sound of early Cecil Taylor—an off-kilter but unapologetic sense of swing pushing even the most abstract phrases forward."" - Peter Margasak, Downbeat",Astral Spirits,https://cadillacturns.bandcamp.com/album/june-holiday,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/charles-rumback-w-jim-baker-john-tate-june-holiday/s-kzkgajTzRlI
Roscoe Mitchell & Mike Reed,the Ritual and the Dance,"""The album was recorded in October of 2015 as part of the Oorstof concert series in Antwerp. The piece starts with Reed weaving sparse bits of percussion around Mitchell's irregular, probing sopranino squawk. These minor sounds quickly accumulate in frequency and velocity as the musicians lock into their heady and physical interplay. Reed is a spectacular drummer, a true lion of the skins he colors his crisp, flowing percussion with subtle and sometimes unexpected sounds. Here he puts on a clinic; the speed, power, and sharpness of his technique serve to soften his pummeling attack, but it is a pummeling nevertheless. Mitchell meets him right in the midst of his tempest, a swirling mass of razorwire sound piercing the din. Reed puts down his sticks and adds some light electronics as Mitchell continues working through his concept, then returns subtly and takes over as Mitchell inhales his first deep breath in a quarter hour. The rhythm relaxes and Reed stretches out, working over his toms and punctuating the maelstrom with violent cymbal work. His pace slows and there is a brief period where the duo employ a slightly more delicate measure. Mitchell, now on alto, plays long, wailing figures against the abstract rhythms of Reed. Mitchell's playing quickens as Reed briefly recoils before going in for the finish. Now on soprano, Mitchell peels off knotty, twisted passages within the barrage. The intensity wanes for a final time and Mitchell softly plays bells against Reed's thumping backbeat and the appreciative whoops of the crowd."" - Nick Metzger, Free Jazz Blog",Astral Spirits,https://astralmitchellreed.bandcamp.com/album/the-ritual-and-the-dance,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/roscoe-mitchell-mike-reed-the-ritual-and-the-dance/s-cP7r2MtpdHM

Signe Emmeluth,Hi Hello I’m Signe,"""Danish saxophonist Signe Emmeluth, who now lives in Oslo after studying in Trondheim, Norway, has made a strong impact on the European free music scene in the last couple of years, not only due to her ferocious sound, but also through a stylistic openness. Her rugged band Amoeba fulfils her compositional interests, while her duo with guitarist Karl Bjorå, Owl, which released a stunning 2020 debut called Mille Feuille, is more spare and contemplative. This solo outing — a single piece recorded live for Ingebrit Håker Flaten’s Sonic Transmissions Festival — contains its fair share of fire-breathing, with tart boppish phrases ricocheting toward the horizon in upper register sallies, but it opens and closes with finely etched restraint, as sibilant, snaking lines build and recede from and into nothingness.

Hali Palombo,Cylinder Loops,"""Hali Palombo’s Cylinder Loops is the first release of 2021 on Astral Editions and upon first glance it may look like a minor one: 12 loops clocking in at 18 minutes. Yet, I’ve been sitting with the loops for a month now and it might be the next keystone release for defining the label’s sound.  Palombo’s 2019 and 2020 works have been tinkering with shortwave radio ghosts and fragments; Cherry Ripe practically summons dispatches from the bomb shelters of the atomic era. Sometimes mournful or monolithic, yet with an undercurrent of warmth and bittersweetness to this era. On Cylinder Loops, Palombo takes a dozen fragments (courtesy of UCSB’s Cylinder Archive), highlighting the ghosts in those auditory fragments. Palombo’s loops will be quite familiar should you have a sweet tooth for Lelyand Kirby and Ghost Box (there lies a hauntology tag at the bottom of its bandcamp page). The cylinder loops have a wicked sense of space they conjure up. Demented carnivals (Loop 8), funeral liturgy (Loop 4), or flickering nitrate print (Loop 3) all provide images of a pre-WWI society on the fringe of a modernity it will soon be crushed under. Palombo then bends that sense of temporality; often pushing the sounds of these loops towards dispatches from futures akin to the dream worlds of Tim Hecker’s Harmony in Ultraviolet (Loop 6/9). The entire affair is precise, not a moment wasted. As a result, it lends itself both to trips across the midwest as much as a rainy morning lost in a foggy haze. You’ll best want to pick this one up before it fades away."" - Matty McPherson, Tabs Out",Astral Editions,https://aecylinderloops.bandcamp.com/album/cylinder-loops,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/hali-palombo-cylinder-loops/s-yOYu1wH7xR5
Ka Baird & Muyassar Kurdi ,Voice Games,"""Primarily voice improvisations from the duo of Muyassar Kurdi and Ka Baird, also performing on piano, bells, gong, flute and spike fiddle, recorded at Pineapple Reality and Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, NY between 2017 & 2018, their work focused on typically delicate interweaving of their voices and instruments, with a sense of suspense, humor and joyful mystery.""

Montgomery & Turner,Sounds Passing Through Circumstances,"""‘Drifting’ is the word I keep coming back to as I sail through Jayve Montgomery and Nick Turner’s Sounds Passing Through Circumstances. Duets for mellotron and flute and saxophone (with effects) that are weightless under starlit night skies as you watch your frozen breath float into the crisp, cold air. Montgomery and Turner are in tune with the harmony of the spheres. Each side-long piece gets deep into meditative hinterlands where thoughts turn inward. Emerald mists from Turner’s mellotron shroud Montgomery’s distant star gazing, his effects-laden flute growing into a web of light. Repetition wields a soft sword on “Circumstance 01,” with flickering, faint percussive elements providing the guideposts as the duo intertwines layers of cosmic, reverb-soaked sound. Montgomery takes off into the cosmos on “Circumstance 02,” piercing through the synthetic aural haze with passages of moving, reflective notes. Sequences of time fall into eternity as you lose yourself to the enveloping sonic stream of consciousness. Sounds Passing Through Circumstances is music for inner reflection. Close your eyes, open your heart and mind and new worlds will materialize. Sacred spaces are endless if you ride on these hypnotic, ethereal waves."" - Brad Rose, Foxy Digitalis

Anáhuac,Y_y,"""This trio, composed of Juan García (double bass), Ignaz Schick (turntable, sampler, electronics) and Chris Cogburn (electronic, percussion), has been using non-idiomatic improvisation since 2016 to propose a new way in which the audience can approach the concept of sound as an art form. That this album bears the word “ascua” (ember) as its title is quite appropriate, since both of its tracks seem to grow as more elements are thrown into them, just as if it were a sonic wood fire; there’s a hissing, static effect that persists throughout the album -like that of a dusty vinyl record- that effectively emulates the sound of something being slowly consumed by a small fire (as we can appreciate on “scoria”) or it might as well represent a liquid reaching its boiling point, as illustrated on “sudar” climax. This time, however, Anáhuac has found a way to use less elements, and the results are far more great, as every nuance and texture is more noticeable; this helps create a deeper sense of immersion. Each member’s contributions are minimal, but vital. This is not a demonstration of virtuosity or manual dexterity, nor it is a relentless attack on the senses: the purpose is not to trace complex melodic or harmonic contours, nor the careful and methodical confection of typical rhythmic patterns, but a fusion in favor of texture and the exploration of the timbral possibilities each element involved has to offer, while maintaining a sense of balance and direction."" - Densidad25

"Threadbare (Jason Stein, Ben Cruz, Emerson Hunt)",Silver Dollar,"""Their debut album, Silver Dollar, is technically free jazz; but as the album unfolds, it’s easy to hear a strong affinity for ‘70s rock bands like Led Zeppelin, and jazz-rock hybrids like the Mahavishnu Orchestra and Soft Machine. The songs begin delicately, often with one instrument, and gather steam as they go, rising to volcanic crescendos before settling into dense, mesmerizing grooves. On “Threadbare,” in particular, Stein opens the track by seemingly blowing into the clarinet without a reed which, when combined with Hunton’s irregular drum pattern and Cruz’s eerie guitar chords, generates feelings of pending doom. At the four-minute mark, the instrumentalists fall into a Latin rhythm that never quite syncs up; but the track thrives even if the timing is slightly off. Compare that with “24 Mesh Veils” and “Funny Thing Is”: Neither song really takes shape at all. The former slowly trudges along, carried by its murky mix of clarinet and guitar. The latter feels nimble, a hard bop track with light drum taps and bright chords that grow more frenetic by the minute."" - Marcus J Moore, Bandcamp Daily",No Business,https://nobusinessrecords.bandcamp.com/album/threadbare-silver-dollar,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/threadbare-silver-dollar/s-O91TIFgaLIh
Mockūnas / Sakata / Yoshihide / Umezu / Koketsu / Hayashi,Luidas Mockūnas In Residency at Bitches Brew,"""Bitches Brew is the club, not the sound of the music – a night spot in Yokohama where European reedman Liudas Mockunas improvised these performances in the company of a range of different Japanese players! The lineup shifts with each track, as do the horns handled by Mockunas – who blows tenor and soprano sax – plus a very cool ""water prepared soprano sax"" – in the company of Akira Sakata on clarinet and alto, Masayo Koketsu on alto, Eiichi Hayashi on alto, Yoshihide Otomo on guitar, and Kazutoki Umezu on bass clarinet, alto, and soprano! All tracks are nice and long, and filled with the sort of sharp reed interplay you'd know from both the music of Mockunas or Sakata – on titles that include ""Brown Line"", ""Green Line"", ""Red Line"", ""Blue Line"", and ""Yellow Line"" - Dusty Groove",No Business,https://nobusinessrecords.bandcamp.com/album/liudas-mock-nas-in-residency-at-bitches-brew,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/mockunas-sakata-yoshihide-umezu-koketsu-hayashi-in-residency-at-bitches-brew/s-QEVPFZiUCnv
Andrew Lamb / Tom Abbs / Michael Wimberly / Guillermo E. Brown,Rhapsody in Black,"""The music of Rhapsody in Black has a distinctive character: it speaks of gentleness, humility, artfulness and dignified cultural embrace. Sax and flute player, Baba Andrew Lamb wastes no time in manifesting the aforementioned qualities in the opening page of the liner notes. The title of the album addresses a celebration of Black Heritage. The first percussion sounds heard are unavoidably spare and soft, but “initiate” (cf. the title of the first track,“Initiation”) a series of beautifully executed discrete strokes on the bass strings by Lamb's decade long collaborator Tom Abbs. The atmosphere built is environmental, say of the jungle, bearing some kind of tribal significance, haunting yells as testimony. Lambs’ clarinet induces an unique sound aura of calling forth spiritual power that pervades the entire album. The bass creates strong arco and pizzicato voices within the group throughout the recording and seems just as prominent instrumentally as the reeds are. Abbs also sputters and rips short glissandos through the tuba to change up the bass colors. But Lamb sings the most intricate songs; he repeats a phrase, rarely arpeggiates and sculpts sturdy and erect melodies, most often in the same gesture on any instrument he plays whether it is the clarinet, the tenor, metal or wooden flute. The percussionists, Michael Wimberly and Guillermo E. Brown, are integral to the group’s musical process. Lamb describes the percussionists' interaction: ""They play together at the same time or accompany each other taking turns."" The drummers commit to holding up the rhythmic content with undying and varying persistence: with light-handedness on cymbals, snare, woodblocks or bells. The pair keeps the music tight, manages its direction and seals its reverence."" --2012 Lyn Horton ",No Business,https://nobusinessrecords.bandcamp.com/album/rhapsody-in-black,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/andrew-lamb-rhapsody-in-black/s-Mgd1sgdP7wV
Detail (Frode Gjerstad / Johnny Dyani / John Stevens),Day Two,"""Sequenced into two LP-side sized pieces, the disc documents a classic extended example of the trio’s egalitarian ethos. Stevens never overshadows his colleagues and the communication lines remain open even when one or more of the players opts for silent listening over sound-driven input. Gjerstad opens on intentionally furtive soprano, tracing melodic figures against the massive throb of Dyani’s strings and the steady tidal tumble of Stevens’ sticks. The speed increases incrementally with tension building organically apace. There’s a stretch near the end of the first piece that dips dangerously close to longueurs where Gjerstad’s tenor appears briefly bereft of directional purpose, but his partners swiftly swoop in to shore the gap with a shared focus. The B-Side develops more deliberately while exuding equal heat."" - Derek Taylor, Dusted",No Business,https://nobusinessrecords.bandcamp.com/album/day-two,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/detail-gjerstad-dyani-stevens-day-two/s-BleBUP3XumR
Sabu Toyozumi / Mats Gustafsson,Hokusai,"""Hokusai is available in LP with three lengthy tracks or CD with the inclusion of an additional solo performance by Gustafsson and Toyozumi. The three duos presented open with ""Sunflower,"" a piece that enters stealthily enough with barely perceptible baritone saxophone breath and minimal percussive pulse. The spell is broken by the cluck and pop of Gustafsson's saxophone and his vocalizations. Toyozumi follows with his stop-start attack which converts into a jagged blast of energy. The pair work a quiet/loud/quiet approach to great effect, drawing you in then jolting you out. ""Woman With A Cat"" finds Gustafsson hoisting both fluteophone and flute. The interaction rotates around the music's tension and release of energy, Toyozumi as tour director here. The music next presents a solo by each performer. Gustafsson returns to the baritone saxophone, applying minimalist sounds incorporating breathy passages, pops, cluck and his vocalizations. Toyozumi's solo relies on space, utilizing quiet as much as pulse here. The pair reunite for the 20+ minute ""For Ever-Advancing Artistry."" Their music finds a meeting of the minds here, with any hesitation that might have been perceived on the previous interactions dissolved.

Magda Mayas' Filamental,Confluence,"Magda Mayas composed this piece for an octet comprised of a who's who of the avant-garde. The score consists of 12 photos taken over an hour or so, observing the merging waters of the Rhône and the Arve rivers, the artificial wall dividing them, the earthy, blue and green colors blending. There are as many defining differences as similarities, depending on what one pays attention to but after a while the differences become apparent. A variety of angles, hues, light, excerpts, focusing on one or the other river or on the in-between areas.

Zeena Parkins / Mette Rasmussen / Ryan Sawyer,Glass Triangle,"""Parkins’ remarkable, and ever-inventive spectrum of sounds, rarely associated with a conventional harp, is at the center of the intense dynamics of this meeting. Rasmussen suggests the urgent, sharp and ecstatic edge of this trio, always pushing forward, while Sawyer adds like-minded frantic, fast-shifting and fragmented rhythmic patterns, but it is Parkins who cements the syntax of this trio, with her heavily-processed and effects-laden electric harp, but insists on a democratic, conversational interplay. Parkins cleverly crisscrosses the high-octane attacks of Rasmussen and Sawyer on the opening “Begiunners, begges, beattle, belt, believers”, sounding like a twisted electric guitar; she intensifies the mysterious, ritualist atmosphere of “Not Bygone, Just Biggone” with eerie, ambient sounds; and she anchors the nervous energy of Rasmussen and Sawyer on “Flod of Trees” with a storm of alien noises."" - Eyal Hareuveni, Free Jazz Blog",Relative Pitch,https://relativepitchrecords.bandcamp.com/album/glass-triangle,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/zeena-parkins-mette-rasmussen-ryan-sawyer-glass-triangle/s-8kicfqEkY14

Keir Neuringer / Shayna Dulberger / Julius Masri,Dromedaries II,"""Dromedaries II presents four improvisations moving between 10 and 13 minutes. Opening improvisation ‘Both’ starts from a theme played by the bassist and repeated over. Drummer Masri joins by playing maniacal shifting patterns and on top Neuringer plays extended lines that quickly become increasingly intense. In the second part, the drummer is in the forefront with sequences of repeated patterns that gradually change in interaction with the bass. Near the end the sax returns once more, staying in the background. ‘Rifts’ starts with a rhythmic pattern by drums and bass. Neuringer joins with his penetrating and slightly dissonant sound. He has his very own distinct and conjuring tone. Drumming by Masri is impressive. He plays his patterns in a non-jazz way influenced by ethnic music, that invites Neuringer to play his inspired lines. ‘Ether’ starts with a very free and energetic dialogue of drums and bass. After the sax joins it develops into very jumpy improvisation. Very wild. In contrast, the closing improvisation ‘Thereafter’ is a more modest one. It is built again on ethnic-inspired percussive patterns that propel the improvisation forward. A strong statement by a trio searching and finding its own voice.""

Wadada Leo Smith / Douglas R. Ewart / Mike Reed,Sun Beans of Shimmering Light,"""The album’s opener, “Constellations And Conjunctional Spaces” sets the tone; Smith and Ewart’s playing melds seamlessly, while Reed’s flourishes add tasteful rhythmic and tonal accents. On “Super Moon Rising,” Smith’s bright tone and Reed’s playing are particularly impressive, providing a dynamic and ever-shifting bed of percussion for Smith and Ewart to play both in and around. “Unknown Forces” begins by showcasing Smith’s strength as a soloist. Smith’s lines are soulful and patiently phrased, jutting out between each daring moment of silence. On Sun Beans of Shimmering Light, these experienced players carry on a legacy of experimental music and boundless creativity that started so many decades ago. That Smith continues to present music from the very cutting edge of jazz and improvised music after so many years of challenging the genre’s conventions is an impressive and inspiring feat.

Chris Williams & Patrick Shiroishi,Sans Soleil,"...but more importantly Sans Soleil comes across less as a trumpet/saxophone duo album and more in line with the sounds of Art Ensemble of Chicago or other forward thinking ""sound"" ensembles.  Synthesizers, glockenspeil and many other objects interject as foreground and background sounds through the entirety of the album. Coming in at over 60 minutes (including the digital bonus track) there is a lot of music to digest here on Sans Soleil, and that might be the best part of all. Both Williams & Shiroishi spent plenty of time working through their respective arsenals of instruments - Williams on Trumpet, Cornet, Flugelhorn and more and Shiroishi on Alto, Tenor, Bari, Soprano & Sopranino saxophones as well as Clarinet and more.

[Ahmed],Nights on Saturn (communication),"""The music does have a hypnotic appeal, particularly when all four musicians succumb fully to the piece's over-the-top mania. Even the most hair-raising moments of Super Majnoon don't reach the volcanic amplitude on display here. The live setting enhances the effect, and the crowd's enthusiastic responses are well-captured throughout the recording. While some listeners may desire a bit more dynamic contrast, or occasionally tire of the essentially iterative quality of the music, there is a fascinating aspect to hearing Wright and Thomas explore and interrogate the figures they conjure—at times seemingly trying to beat them into submission—while seeking even more ecstatic heights. For its sheer cathartic power, Nights on Saturn is indeed an accomplishment.""

Kuzu,The Glass Delusion,"""Kuzu recordings are highly instinctual and intuitional; the same can be said about any quality improv music unit. Where Kuzu makes its mark is that each of its members, Dave Rempis (saxes), Tashi Dorji (guitar) and Tyler Damon (drums), are highly individualistic musicians who play their instruments well outside the bounds of conformity. There are sounds you don’t often hear from each of these instruments and even less so as a group.

Michael Foster & Ben Bennett,Contractions,"""The intimate yet stormy duet feature both Foster and Bennett all over their instruments, pushing themselves and their instruments sonic ranges into the most extreme terrains. Foster talks and shouts through the saxes mouthpieces and often uses his instruments as percussive instruments in addition to his strong rhythmic articulation while Bennett blows on his membranes as if there were reeds instruments. Both have developed such a close affinity that they can shift the level of intensity and energy within a second or instantly alternate between a muscular, roaring blow-out and an abstract, almost silent sonic searches. There is a sense of thematic development to Foster and Bennett performance as both communicate a kind of story full of hair-raising adventures and wild twists that demands a certain showmanship.

Derek writes, “I absolutely love this” and I can understand why. It’s absolutely enveloping, gorgeous, strung out with dissonance and texture and a silence all the more eloquent for the occasional disruption and distortion. Or, Avant Music News puts it, “Kidambi eschews singing for drones, mouth and throat noises, and plaintive tones, unbending in her lack of orthodoxy. Liberatore provides his own drones as well as long-held notes and dissonant chords on an undistorted electric guitar.

Landon Caldwell & Nick Yeck-Stauffer,Unity in Isolation,"""And what I’m feeling right now in an immense drifting sensation, lost in the trance of Landon Caldwell’s organ drone and synthesizer keys; it’s a deviously simple ambient core you can imagine. Completely ruling side A, the seventeen minute suite, “Ugly Connection,” finds Nick Yeck-Stuaffer swirling through the ambience with his otherworldly pocket trumpet blasts. The two Crazy Doberman members had some of the most notable moments on Illusory Expansion from last year — in fact, I’m quite certain Staffer’s trumpet is the opening note! Here though, they really chew the scenery and spread out like the ocean floor. Caldwell’s hypnotic keys try to stay locked into a reverent melody as Stauffer’s trumpet playing reaches its most punchdrunk at the suite’s climax.

Gryphon Rue & Merche Blasco,North of the Future,"The shimmering Super Tender introduces us to North Of The Future’s entrancing sound worlds, equal parts elegy, experiment, and sonic prism capturing 2020’s wake. North Of The Future is a homebound duet between Rue and Blasco with instrumental interlocutors. The scarcely governable voice of Blasco’s EMS Synthi AKS (“Cintia”) and her singing saw entangle signals with Rue’s singing saw, harmonium, and custom modular synths (“Fritz”). A rare model from 1972, Cintia’s frayed circuitry gives the synth a special character – she interjects, digresses, changes the conversation. Ffffffffffff. Zeeeeerrrrt. Pft Pfa Pfta. At times in the music Cintia’s temperament is directly invoked: the comedic squeals which burst forth from the droning opening chords of Cintia On Fritz were elicited by rolling an orange up and down Cintia’s conductive keyboard.

Based on the strength of this wild performance, the meeting of these astoundingly creative minds was severely overdue. Throughout the record, the group creates highly-textured seas of tense and feral sound, often bordering on the atonal. Dorji plucks odd and twangy notes on guitar while Meadows creates menacing guttural drones on his double bass while McColm attacks a wide assortment of percussion instruments and objects with a rabid fierceness."" - Record Crates United",Trouble in Mind,https://tashidorjiianmccolmfrankmeadows.bandcamp.com/album/the-power-,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/tashi-dorji-ian-mccolm-frank-meadows-the-power-of-water/s-On3psaItxOZ
Landon Caldwell,Deep Strand,"""If your Friday is looking for a little comedown, then the new cassette from Landon Caldwell (Crazy Doberman, Creeping Pink, Thee Open Sex) should do the trick. A part of Trouble in Mind’s explorer’s series, the solo set from Caldwell explores an ambient cosmic float, wafting in on synth clouds thick and satisfying. A weary sax turn the album closer, “What Seems Like the End Is Also A Beginning” into a welcome melt into the atmosphere. As Caldwell, aided here by Tom Lageveen, leads the listener into the light the boundaries between molecules begin to dissolve.

The outfit brings a sprawling 70-minute affair to the table with patch-working motorik rhythms, ambient synth trances, post-punk dub, and psychedelic shredders. As comfortable skronking off into astral heights as they are sludging through the muck, Writhing Squares’ unapologetic cacophony is a true testament to the shrieking discord of our present times.

Mac Blackout,Love Profess,"""An album that starts with the sort of free jazz that feels at least familiar, things move quickly beyond ""Wandering Spheres"" and into other territory entirely. ""Forever"" finds Mac using sax and faint keyboard samples to craft something nearly ambient, but thoroughly unsettling, while ""Magic Hour 2020"", with vocal samples from a younger Mac Blackout, is more Fad Gadget than John Coltrane. Elsewhere, ""Revolutionary Tide"" uses horn honks to punctuate a ruminative exploration of electronica, while the lovely clsoer ""Dear Mom"" reminded me of an Underworld number, or something from Eno. Love Profess is going to get hyped as a jazz record and that's unfortunate. It's really something else entirely, and it's likely going to disappoint anyone looking for jazz. That said, it's sure to inspire anyone who's looking for something bravely iconoclastic. Skipping over genre labels, Mac Blackout deftly charts his own path here, offering up something that's moody and very effective, and oddly emotoional in spots."" - A Pessimist is Never Disappointed",Trouble in Mind,https://macblackout.bandcamp.com/album/love-profess,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/mac-blackout-love-profess/s-C3jPFEEPft8
David Nance,Staunch Honey,"""Nance’s latest studio album, Staunch Honey, features the sharpest and most distinctive songwriting of his career, but the sound remains gloriously unrefined. According to a press release, he reworked the material three times before settling on these renditions: recorded at home, directly to tape, with just a few appearances from collaborators like guitarist Jim Schroeder and drummer Kevin Donahue. (Thus it’s billed as a solo album, as opposed to 2018’s Peaced and Slightly Pulverised, released as the David Nance Group.)"" - Pitchfork",Trouble in Mind,https://davidnance.bandcamp.com/album/staunch-honey,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/david-nance-staunch-honey/s-xyiFggrakm7
Matchess,Huizkol,"The seven updrafts of Huizkol are an opportunity to engage with your own skepticism or belief in the effects of sound on the body. The album consists of 7 tracks on each side, 7 minutes each, a meditation on the dualities of sevens. The Active mix is suited to listening while doing, and the Passive mix is intended for devoted attention to inner reality. The theory of brainwave entrainment suggests that through sustained listening brain activity will adapt to the rate of beating binaural frequencies. Huizkol gradually raises this rate to an energetic centerpiece before returning to an ultimately relaxed state. The album is inspired by the Anne Carson poem ""The Wolf God"" in which she discovers how an immortal canis named Huizkol learned to cope with sonic disequilibrium.",Trouble in Mind,https://matchess.bandcamp.com/album/huizkol,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/matchess-huizkol/s-FOwXCAOns1v
Bil Vermette,Hunting For Planet 9,"""Bil Vermette has been making ambient and electronic soundscapes for more than 40 years, and his new album, Hunting for Planet 9, won’t disappoint fans looking for another collection of instrumental, synthesizer-heavy space waves to add to their playlist. The Berwyn musician became known for his hypnotic compositions as a member of late-70s synth collective VCSR, and after the band split in the early 80s, Vermette began self-releasing solo work on his own Rainforest Productions label, starting with 1984’s Katha Visions (reissued in 2013 by the Galactic Archive label run by Reader contributor Steve Krakow, in conjunction with Permanent Records). Vermette’s sound is rooted in the music of pioneering electronic groups such as Tangerine Dream and Cluster, and on Hunting for Planet 9 he continues on his galaxy quest with melodic, gently celestial tracks such as “Saturn’s Rings” and “Kuiper Belt.” The album begins with the ominous “Space #8,” whose loud, dissonant patchwork of sound feels like it could propel you to the darkest corners of the Milky Way—and then the next track, “Surface of Titania,” arrives with a gentle bounce to return you to the comforts of the solar system. With its playful variety of spacy dynamics, Hunting for Planet 9 is a welcome voyage through electronic sound that will clear your head for takeoff."" - Salem Collo-Julin, Chicago Reader",Trouble in Mind,https://bilvermette.bandcamp.com/album/hunting-for-planet-9,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/bil-vermette-hunting-for-planet-9/s-MwBRmTYAWIA
FACS,Present Tense,"Chicago trio FACS never stop pushing forward; they’ve honed and refined their stark, minimal scrape and clatter for four years and counting, having risen out of the ashes of beloved Chicago band Disappears in 2018 with the bone-rattling intensity of Negative Houses. After three albums in the past three years, the trio return in 2021 with Present Tense, their fourth album and perhaps their sharpest statement as a band. Opener “XOUT” barrels forward like a tank, with Case’s guitar chiming like warning bells, until the climax comes crashing down, glitching out near the close. “Strawberry Cough” comes next, its fusion of corporeal playing and stately, electronic heartbeats punctured by random bursts of noise or backwards masked sounds. “Alone Without”, a track originally recorded for Adult Swim’s 2020 singles series appears next, albeit in different form; more menacing and serpentine. Side two opens with “General Public”, taking the loud/quiet dynamic as a jumping off point for the song’s unsettling seasick vibe. ‘How To See In the Dark” offers a brief respite, with its persistent, dark quietude that lingers until the song’s end. “Present Tense”, the album’s title track, offers up its first truly weird moment mid-song when the song changes mood distinctly, and the music drops out save for Case’s guitar and vocals. The album’s final track, the densely packed “Mirrored”, begins with a restrained, post-rock shuffle. The mind-scrambling cacophony that comes next takes its time to roll in, but once it does, it comes in waves, flipping back onto itself multiple times until it’s folded into oblivion.

Mountain Movers,World What World,"Mountain Movers arguably are the perfect band for all the true “heads” out there. The New Haven quartet have been at it for 15 years, and the “newest” lineup (now at it for well over a decade; vocalist/guitarist Dan Greene, bassist Rick Omonte, guitarist Kryssi Battalene and drummer Ross Menze) have firmly grasped what it takes to fry brains; achingly beautiful melodies buoyed by a life raft of white-hot guitar scree and mind-melting feedback. “World What World” is the band’s eighth album and third for Trouble In Mind Records.",Trouble in Mind,https://themountainmovers.bandcamp.com/album/world-what-world,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/mountain-movers-world-what-world/s-xeiUgdGTHFK
