Andrew Barker & Daniel Carter,Polyhedron,"""The first duo album from Andrew Barker (Barker Trio, Gold Sparkle Trio, Acid Birds, Little Huey Creative Orchestra) and Daniel Carter (too many groups to mention) since 2001's ""Common Soldier"" (Qbico). ""Polyhedron"" finds Barker & Carter stretching the classic sax & drums duo into all kinds of wild territories and featuring each of their multi-instrumental talents throughout. Each piece is dedicated to colleagues that they have both worked with in the past & present (Roy Campbell, Sabir Mateen, William Parker & Charles Water). Both Daniel Carter & Andrew Barker have spent countless years honing their craft, together and individually...two true masters getting intensely deep.""

Matthew Lux Communication Arts Quartet,Contra / Fact,"""Given his history, it's remarkable that the new Contra/Fact release is Lux's first album under his own name—it's billed to Matthew Lux's Communication Arts Quartet. Even though he's clearly privileged working as an ensemble member over pushing a musical agenda of his own, you'd think he would've gotten around to a project of his own sooner. His band on Contra/Fact includes drummer Mikel Patrick Avery, cornetist Ben Lamar Gay, and reedist Jayve Montgomery, all of whom add percussion or electronics to their main instrumental contribution. The album covers lots of terrain, including post-Miles Davis electric grooves (the sultry ""C.G.L.W.""), hypnotic, probing space voyages (""Colonial Gysins""), shape-shifting modal adventures (""Israels'""), and post-swing ballads (""Gris/Bleu,"" which Lux built from Lester Young's earthy solo on his legendary 1957 performance of ""Fine and Mellow"" for the TV show The Sound of Jazz). Even when the music pushes into the abstract (""Mercury Lights""), it continues to emphasize a strong, thick pulse. Below you can check out another smoky ballad, ""Ninna Nanna."" - Peter Margasak, Chicago Reader

Hearts & Minds,Electroradiance,"""Stein's woody sound with funk, rock, electronics, and free jazz. Opening with a swampy synth-bass line, Giallorenzo then adds an electric piano dance around Taylor's pulse, all in service of Stein's aeronautics. Taylor who replaced now ex-pat Frank Rosaly in the trio, is well versed in these affairs, having powered various Chicago Underground ensembles with Rob Mazurek and more recently Jaimie Branch's Fly Or Die and the tremendous duo with James Brandon Lewis. He doesn't shy aways from dance and rock beats, muscling the pulse on ""Step'n"" with an additional pulse from Giallorenzo, who marches in step with Stein, before the composition transitions into some bebop. If you're thinking Sun Ra, you'd be correct. The title track comes straight from El Saturn Research laboratories with scorched circuits and blips, as the members skate the very edges of their instruments. In a blink of an eye (or did a millennia pass?) ""Shreveport"" evolves into a Promethean New Orleans march accented with a deep bass line, and the simple melody bleeds into a continuous outward path."" - Mark Corroto, All About Jazz

Brandon Seabrook w/Cooper Moore & Gerald Cleaver,Exultatins,"""Like the music, the recording is bigger than life, almost cinematic. Check out the deeply earthy “Absurdities in Bondage” to hear just how deep and wide a rhythm section can come across in recorded technicolor, due in no small part to Cooper-Moore’s whoops and slides as the diddley-bow takes on a humanity of its own. Thudding, crashing through the false boundaries of history, progress and construct, each cycle delineated by what it would be tasteless merely to call a snare pop, Seabrook’s dense harmonies make the whole edifice float. His guitarwork throughout is unlike any I’ve heard. Sure, you can trace everything from Red-era King Crimson to Ornette Coleman and Pat Metheny’s groundbreaking Song X as the music rips, swings and liquefies along its chosen trails, but no allusion can address its simultaneous density and surprising clarity, not to mention the harmonic syntax that seems to be Seabrook’s own. It’s thorny, it’s exciting, and it’s unique, and that’s quite a combination for a trio format that could easily have warn out its welcome with the first track. Seabrook proves himself to be one of the most creative guitarists around, and the trio is a unit with which to reckon."" - Marc Medwin, Dusted Magazine.

Their collective imagination and speed of response betrays no age-related dampening of the firing neurons. Momentary connections, which vouchsafe intent, listening and shared purpose, illuminate the dense organic flow.

DUX Orchestra,duck walks dog (with mixed results),"""The cover of the 1994 archival recording Duck Walks Dog (With Mixed Results) by the DUX Orchestra presents an intriguing line up which combines American free jazzers with Swedish baritone saxophonist Mats Gustafsson. Even within the New York City contingent there is diversity, as veteran stickman Walter Perkins (who played with Sonny Rollins, Roland Kirk and Charles Mingus among many others) rubs shoulders with young drummer Susie Ibarra (in her pre-David S. Ware days), stalwart reedmen Dave Sewelson and Will Connell Jr, and bassist Dave Hofstra, the last four all members of bassist William Parker's Little Huey Creative Music Orchestra at the time. Then there is the little-known guitarist jc morrison (who styles himself all lower case). And it's actually morrison who is key to this session, as a visit to his website divulges. At the time, DUX was an informal grouping around the guitarist, Sewelson, Perkins and Parker, which could expand to include others, as it did to meet morrison's orchestral ambitions on this occasion. Although only seven strong, the outfit offers a full, if bottom heavy, palette and takes a widescreen approach to marshalling the resources on hand, courtesy of loose arrangements by morrison and Sewelson."" - John Sharpe, All About Jazz

Steve Swell / Robert Boston / Michael Vatcher,Brain in a Dish,"""Swell is particularly impressive on these pieces, his distinct growls and jagged clusters a trombonist’s delight. Swell alters his tone with mutes on “Tastier than Oranges”, “Trepanation Trepidation” and “How Do You Like Yours?” while on “Fried and Roasted?” he toys with swooshing plunges, toy sounds and blubber notes, while Vatcher lays low before becoming an aggressive foil. Boston serves softballs on organ on “Neurons”, over which Swell swerves and splats deliciously like a drunken sailor. Brain In A Dish could just as easily be called “The Many Sides of Steve Swell”, as the recording capitalizes on many of the extended techniques of which he is a master. It will satisfy his fans and, due to its diversity, is also a good entry point to his music."" - Steven Loewy, New York City Jazz Record

Joe McPhee | Hamid Drake,Keep Going,"""Keep Going displays everything which makes Joe McPhee’s music so great. “Keep Going“, the title track, is the only one that highlights McPhee’s roots in blues and gospel so prominently. Pieces like “For Don't Let 'Em Drop Them Goddam Nukes On Us Lord“ and “Morning Star (for Lucy Stone)“ reach back to a 1960s- and 70s-tradition of free jazz, to musicians like Albert Ayler, Frank Lowe and Noah Howard. In these pieces McPhee hurls out angry, convulsive riffs, blurred, overblown messages, which are propelled by Drake’s nervous drum rolls. On three tracks, “Medgar / Malcolm / Martin“, “Makes Me Wanna Holler (For Representative John Lewis)“ and “Time Was (for Barack Hussein Obama)“ McPhee is on pocket trumpet. At one point in the latter piece he plays into an open gong, which adds otherworldly overtones to his music. This is the other side of his music, the introspective and meditative one, which is rather interested in sound excursion. All this is accompanied by Hamid Drake’s subtle and emphatic percussion, as usual deeply rooted in a black jazz tradition. On the one hand it perfectly supports McPhee’s traditional side, on the other hand it contrasts the experimental approach telling a very old story from a different angle."" - Martin Schray, Free Jazz Blog.",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://joemcphee.bandcamp.com/album/keep-going-3,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/joe-mcphee-hamid-drake-keep-going/s-ozYV9NKsiIo
Joe McPhee,The Willisau Concert,"""Asked which of his out-of-print records he’d like to see available again, multi-instrumentalist Joe McPhee’s response was immediate: The Willisau Concert! Recorded at the Swiss festival that gave it its name in 1975, it appeared a year later as Hat Hut B, the second of the new label’s great letter series. It came packaged gorgeously in a double-gatefold with artist Klaus Baumgärtner’s stunning pen-and-ink work on the inside and out and a little hand-colored Swiss flag on the interior of each copy. Returning to the music, it’s easy to hear why McPhee holds it so dear. He’s in absolute top form on tenor and soprano saxophones, ranging from the relaxed and confident Afro-conscious feel of Nation Time to areas of more diffuse and textural investigation. John Snyder’s analog synthesizer is brilliant and hyperbolic, a surprisingly hand-in-glove match for McPhee, not dissimilar to their collaboration on the CjR release Pieces of Light. South African drummer Makaya Ntshoko is the surprise element, a guest whose sensitivity and warmth are everywhere evident, even when he kicks the energy up a notch. Along with McPhee originals, this reissue includes a never-released bonus, their take on the classic “God Bless the Child,” a total heartbreaker. The CD has been designed as a facsimile cover of the LP, respecting the beautiful and original graphic work on this classic record. Never before available in any digital form, remastered from the original tapes, The Willisau Concert is restored to its place as one of McPhee’s masterpieces."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey

Lindsay / Vandermark / McPhee / Sudderberg,Largest Afternoon,"""One day in the studio, something ridiculously great happened. It was deep Chicago winter, cold as shit. Four musicians assembled for a round-robin set of improvisations - duets, trios, a few quartets. Approached casually, the late morning bloomed into Largest Afternoon, 15 cracking encounters between guitarist Arto Lindsay, saxophonists Joe McPhee and Ken Vandermark, and drummer Phil Sudderberg. No expectations - open minds and creative intent. Lindsay, a brilliant singer and songwriter and one of the key architects of No Wave via his band DNA, has proven himself once again to be one of the world's top texturalists, and he is an equally sensitive and challenging group-improviser. Vandermark and McPhee brought their long friendship and musical partnership to the studio, and both engaged with Lindsay in different ways, bringing blue flame and melody. The session's final wildcard, Sudderberg, a versatile drummer who collaborates with Vandermark in the band Marker, brought a lovely sense of buoyancy and ear for contrast in colors, as well as a raucous rock pulse. WIth parts this stellar, imagine when Largest Afternoon > than the sum. Nobody knew this would happen. - Corbett vs. Dempsey

In an extra intimate studio setting in upstate New York, where bothplayers reside, No Time Left for Sadness demonstrates their incredible musical understanding. Recalling some of McPhee’s landmark records with Marseilles musicians in terms of telepathy and trust, it’s an outing whose intensity is measured not in decibels, but in emotional integrity. Across three tracks of increasing length, culminating in the 31-minute-long adventure “Next Time,” McPhee (hear featured on tenor saxophone exclusively) and Lonberg-Holm redefine chamber music, casting string and reed in a joyous and longing place, a rec room set aflame, a library engulfed in tidewater, a throbbing mezzanine."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey

Joanna Mattrey,Veiled,"""The second half starts with ""A mouthful of dirt"" which wails its lament from the start before briefly (suddenly) receding into a hushed micro-dialogue and a powerful reprise. I think the next piece, ""Come to bury to exhume"" is my favorite of the collection. Though there is constant motion I feel like so much more is hinted at than actually played. Almost like pieces are missing, but enough is given to discern their shapes. The short ""Grey Eyes"" cuts an icy figure against the previous piece, setting it's jarring pizzicato to a continuous, brittle scrape of rosined hair. ""For the Thrall"" starts out playfully percussive, gradually layering on warped abstractions that squeak, hiccup, and howl. The closer ""Descant"" is the final and longest piece of the collection. The first half of the dirge is mostly build-up, with Mattrey working momentum into her static arco before pushing into more uncertain territory where, similar to ""Come to bury to exhume"", she shades in darkness to elevate the light.

Tim Berne | Nasheet Waits,The Coandā Effect,"""It's not exactly free improvisation, as it's clear throughout that Berne is drawing from themes and phrases from which he extrapolates longer, winding digressions; but Waits is so skillful in traversing Berne's unique pathways while leaving plenty of room for new developments that the music seems inherently fresh and undetermined. There's a sense that anything can happen. Of the album's two tracks, the forty-minute ""Tensile"" is the most impressive, with Berne moving through a handful of set pieces that serve as launching pads for his and Waits' musings. Ranging from lilting to torrid to deeply soulful, it displays the full scope of Berne's facility on alto, and Waits' similar ability to shift registers is noteworthy. He relies especially on his toms, which have a compelling tunefulness that renders his instrument a perfect complement for Berne, whether in his languorous or his more extroverted moments."" - Troy Dostert, All About Jazz

Erin Rogers,Dawntreader,"""Dawntreader is her first solo release and while I came into it cold, it won me over with its broad range of dynamics and timbre. On ""Beacon"" Rogers explores the tenor's upper register, twisting her piercing multiphonic yelps and whimpers against themselves in long segments of circular breathing intercut with well-timed and perfunctory silences. On several of the latter passages she vocalizes long glissandos as she plays, which result in powerful and sublime resonances that sound as though they might explosively flower the bell of her horn at any moment. The aptly titled ""Surface Tension"" bubbles with breathy swells and reed pops that create a palpable sense of anxiety, especially over the first half of the piece. One of the things I enjoy the most about the piece is that you can almost feel the vibrations from her horn. It becomes malleable in her hands, a medium as fluid as the air it wields."" - Nick Metzger, Free Jazz Blog

James Brandon Lewis,An UnRuly Manifesto,"""But this isn’t a concept album—it’s a work of immediacy and engagement. Without even offhand reference to spirituality, Lewis leads his ensemble down paths of ferocious polyphony that Albert Ayler and John Coltrane took for transcendence. He’s more secular. Peace, for Lewis, seems to be a matter of grappling with issues in the here and now, a grounded aesthetic stance like that of Archie Shepp or Sonny Rollins. Trumpeter Jaimie Branch, on Lewis’ first album featuring another horn player, stays close to him, adding swaggering gestures, bleats, blurts and Don Cherry-esque clarion calls. The rhythm section, a power unto itself, is back from Lewis’ No Filter. Bassist Luke Stewart, while establishing himself, ably evokes Lewis’ past collaborator, Jamaaladeen Tacuma, as well as Haden. Drummer Warren Trae Crudup III’s slap-happy fills drive the ensemble, his busyness a productive goad. Guitarist Anthony Pirog comes up with fascinating backgrounds, wild effects and sweet leads (for instance, at the end of “Notes”). Lest we forget jazz was forged by breaking norms, An Unruly Manifesto celebrates the aspirations, complications and results of freedom."" - Howard Mandel, Downbeat

Magda Mayas & Jim Denley,Tempe Jetz,"""The duo projects organic minimalism amid the sounds of nature and bizarre tone poems that move forward in asymmetrical fashion. At times Mayas seems to be tinkering with the innards of her clavinet as Denley counterbalances and tints many of these fragmented motifs with otherworldly sounds, where the trajectories are either solemn, nervy, peaceful or droning. The field recordings are melded somewhere in between or in the background and not always easy to detect.

Michael Foster / Michael Zerang / Katherine Young,Bind the Hand(s) That Feed,"""I think it’s worth stressing that extended techniques/preparations aren’t used here as highlights, as punctuation, or to add color. They are the name of the game. It’s almost like listening to an alien species, and the deeper you listen, the more you are rewarded. There is an uncommon depth to the music, mainly due to the proficiency of the artists at improvising with these sorts of sounds. It doesn’t seem as if there’s any real-time experimentation going on, at least none that I can discern (the phrase ‘I meant to do that’ keeps coming to mind). The musicians have such fluency in this style of improvisation that the resulting album borders on some sort of magic. What at first seems like chaotic, punitive noise transforms itself into something sublime with a bit of concentration, comparable to a sonic autostereogram. No doubt about it, this will be a difficult record for some, but it’s also a very special one.

All this amid held gurgle and flanging metals. A riveting introduction and an announcement of what's to come. The textures on display, along with the rapidly evolving rhythmic interplay should hold the listener's attention like a vice. An explosion of high-pitched information during ""Sparrow's Tea"" is frantically beautiful and the duo develop it by manipulating the timbre in such a way that the whole enterprise seems to be spinning around the room. Dropped into the middle of this display one would be hard-pressed to name what instruments were gushing this amazing dialogue. It is very often the case with this recording. ""Below The Hull"" pairs moisture and thumps, and ""The Mended Lid"" displays Morse code wind and head-high squeal in high speed discourse. When the pair do eventually resort to more ""normal"" sounding sax/drum interplay (""Sitting Still While the House Next Door Burns""), it comes as a surprise, another facet of their constructions. Turn the diamond in your fingers and listen to the the light dance."" - Jeph Jerman

Dustin Laurenzi,Snaketime: The Music of Moondog,"The brilliance of Moondog’s work, Laurenzi’s abilities as an organizer (a bandleader), and the individual strengths of the contributors, who solo and interact like undisputed heavyweight champions (but agile!) is evident throughout, but it’s “Fiesta Piano Solo” that registers as Snaketime’s centerpiece. The playing builds to a raucous peak (befitting the free jazz atmosphere) but never crosses over into the formidable, with the audience applause heard at a few points on the record indicative of an evening of collective joy. But it’s the emphasis on melody and the obvious respect for Moondog’s compositional structures that makes Snaketime: The Music of Moondog stand out all the more, as the pleasure in organized spontaneity (for the players and those witnessing) captured at the Hungry Brain easily extends to the stereo environment today and assuredly for more many tomorrows."" - Joseph Neff, Vinyl District

Mars Williams,An Ayler Xmas Vol 4: Chicago vs. NYC,"""One would think that a combination of Ayler and Xmas music would be a disaster of global proportions. But it is not. In fact, Ayler’s outside-oriented tunefulness can be directly applied to traditional melodies, such as The 12 Days of Christmas, Jingle Bells, Carol of the Bells, and so on. In addition to making this astute observation, Williams also arranges medleys of these pieces, reinterpreted with free jazz interludes and blowouts. Thus, on these recordings, the holiday spirit pokes its head out from time to time but gets immediately smashed by Williams’ hammer of musical blasphemy. You hear twinges of the Xmas music, a lot of Ayler, all put together in an irreverent – and yet joyous – fashion."" - Mike Borella, Avant Music News

Spires That In The Sunset Rise,House Ecstatic (Cover Your Blood),"""Spires That in the Sunset Rise, the duo composed of Ka Baird and Taralie Peterson, has been around since 2001, which is crazy, because that was eighteen years ago now, and also 9/11 happened then (#NeverForget). Somebody compared them to Sun City Girls once, and who am I to judge. (Oh right, music critic. Still, carry on.) Now, on their first release for Astral Spirits, the duo get ""ecstatic,"" that is, ""House Ecstatic,"" the name of this tape, which has a subtitle, ""(Cover Your Blood),"" that I guess helps us line up our expectations a little bit. See, each track is titled ""X stat [number],"" like each one is a hit to the bloodstream, and each piano trill and sax blurt and clarinet run and flute ... jab (?) spikes through your heartbeat like adrenalized lightning. There's the blood! Ecstasy in the blood. There are weird chant-y voices on here too, which sort of heighten the playfulness of this partnership at points, like when they meet the shaker percussion on ""X stat twentyfive,"" for example. In the end, the pairing of Spires and Astral Spirits is perfect, and why hasn't it happened sooner, I wonder? Seriously, somebody tell me."" - Ryan Masteller, Tabs Out

Shiroishi / Golia / Fujioka / Cline,Borasisi,"""When done properly, a recording with two drummers can be exquisite, and that is exactly what Fujioka and Cline provide. They effectively merge to the point where it is virtually impossible for the listener to tell where one starts and the other stops. Their long duet at the beginning of Left Eye Moon exemplifies this point, an ever-shifting rhythmic non-pattern that is wildly unpredictable. Whether intentional or not, this 32-minute album represents a pairing of collaborators from two different generations of free improv – Golia and Cline being the elder statesmen while Shiroishi and Fujioka represent the growing millennial contribution to this loose genre. But there is no sense of passing the torch. Instead, Borasisi is a cooperative alliance of equals – four accomplished improvisers who know how to bring the best out of themselves and each other."" - Mike Borella, Avant Music News

Phicus,Solid,"""""Solid"" is a very different album but not only because the songs are named after molecular or atomic substance whose natural abundance is in solid-state. The music keeps its exploratory nature and is full of ""fake"" sounds, yet it belongs more to the avant-garde guitar'n'bass'drums genre. But it should neither be viewed like Fred Frith's Massacre or Derek Bailey's ""Guitar, Drums 'n' Bass"", as they both have very ""traditional"" rhythmic structures, nor should it be viewed as the music of the trios plus saxophone like ""Last Exit"" with Peter Brotzmann, Bill Laswell, Ronald Shannon Jackson and Sonny Sharrock, or Human Feel with Chris Speed, Andrew D'Angelo, Jim Black and Kurt Rosenwinkel. In this sense, Phicus is much more avant-garde, free improvising and complex. The drums and percussion do generate rhythms, but completely free. There are short fragments when one can evoke the middle parts of Jimi Hendrix' ""Star Spangled Banner"", but these are also very concise. In short, there is nothing comparable to this music, period."" - Maciej Lewenstein.

Adam Caine Quartet,Transmissions,"""""Night Driver"" has a lyric two-guitar head melody that sounds vaguely Jerry Garcia-ish-meets-ECM but then in a B section a lovely contrasting chordal motif. Straight after it's off to the short solos including Adam Lane sounding very fresh. ""Cloud Over"" has Elvin Jones-ish swing and a two-guitar head melody that meshes wonderfully well in bluesy lyricism. The guitar solos built over a loosely together propulsion sound a little post-Jerry again while they rock jazzishly. With second guitar comping very nicely the Caine guitar solos  to me in a very hip way. It all moves beyond in another sort of post-Dead fullness. This is as fine an electric outing as I've heard this year. It has a thoughtful air about it, and at the same time wails out with feeling when it needs to. A guitar joy, this is!

Juan Vinuesa Jazz Quartet,Blue Shots From Chicago,"""Blue Shots from Chicago isn't as rough as Ornette!, the album is much more accessible, the heads are more melodic and mellow, the improvisations less overbearing. Vinuesa's sax is fierce and excited, and provided with a kind of epiphanic overtones, but then as well cool in the style of Lee Konitz. Roebke's bass is skillful as it is equipped with a tilting, creeping subtlety. Avery is a very reliable swinging drummer, but he can also play freely (e.g. in “In Paul's Mirror“). Josh Berman is the most seductive musician throughout, charmingly he adds short moments that could pass as swinging blues (especially in “Red Line Ballad“). He simply sounds wonderful here – contributing some heartbreaking moments. If you think this sounds cheesy, there are always enough skronks in between to avoid monotony or sentimentality."" - Martin Schray, Free Jazz Blog.

Billy Bang / William Parker,Medicine Buddha,"""Bang plays a slow, rapturous melody over an arco bass drone in the title track, before leaving Parker to his own devices. With bow in hand the bassist fuses gentle and rough sonorities in a solo that could be described as career defining. His partner returns with equally furious bowing that opens new textural pathways for the violin. Before you realize it, 22 minutes have flown by. Bang later switches to kalimba on one track and Parker picks up both the shakuhachi and the stringed dousn gouni, all adding to the expanse of their dialogue. Rather than improvising the whole set, they also perform two Parker compositions. “Eternal Planet” is a flowing piece that pays tribute to the late violinist Leroy Jenkins. Unlike the rest of the set, the closing “Buddha’s Joy” builds on a steady bass vamp, showing the duo was just as comfortable inside as outside."" - Mike Shanley, Jazz Times.

Joe McPhee,Alone Together: The Solo Ensemble Recordings 1974 & 1979,"""In his upstate NY secret laboratory, home-based in Poughkeepsie, Joe McPhee diligently documented his activities throughout the '70s, with the help of Craig Johnson, the producer who started CjR as an outlet for McPhee's music. Among the unreleased tapes waxed in that span, Alone Together is unique and especially beautiful. Like Sound on Sound (released by Corbett vs. Dempsey in 2010), these recordings make use of multitrack recording, overdubbing McPhee upon McPhee, however where those earlier recordings had an experimental tendency, the Alone Together tracks were more compositional in nature, allowing the multi-instrumentalist to build and sculpt each piece, creating complete wind ensembles one track at a time. In 1974 and then again in a longer session in 1979, McPhee recorded in concise solo, duo, and trio contexts, and in more extensive brass and reed quartets – all McPhee, all the time. Going head-to-head with the best of the saxophone foursomes of the era, McPhee is a one-man-WSQ, his probing investigations and lyrical statements as incisive and insightful as those of his best-known recordings."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey

They present a little-known aspect of his early work, his interest in multi-track recording, here executed on a device known as a Sound On Sound tape machine. When he performed live in concert with the device, he called it his ""Survival Unit."" McPhee aficionados will particularly enjoy the new-old soul/free jazz classic ""Cosmic Love.""

Blue Line comes from a concert in Rouen, France, when McPhee played on a double bill with the Peter Brötzmann/Han Bennink duo.

The bassist unfurls deep, woody lines and the drummer peppers his flow with wonderfully jarring, chaotic accents, but despite the turbulence they forge an inexorable sense of forward motion, providing a platform for the cornetist to toggle masterfully between lyric flurries and knotted outbursts. Unlike the airtight miniatures on A Dance and a Hop, these pieces allow the players to resituate the same language onto a wide-open plane—pushing and pulling in changing directions and allowing spontaneous motifs to play out fully, although each musician never lets any single notion overstay it’s welcome."" - Peter Margasak

Macie Stewart & Lia Kohl,Pocket Full of Bees,"""I think of Pocket Full of Bees as practices in approaching harmony and resonance with the self, the instrument, and one another. The similar timbres of the violin and cello further compliment each other by employing similar technique simultaneously. Both saw, radiating overtones, and Kohl’s droning propeller plane is met with Stewart’s whistling tea kettle on “Big Space Little Nothing;” Kohl and Stewart tap the strings with the bow, bow below the bridge, and strike the strings on “Toothpick Bicycle;” and the cello and violin fall into a rhythmic pluck together on “There’s Something In My Sock (It’s Good).” Like their soundings, their voicings are often similar to each other timbrally and technically, with both emitting oohs, eees, aaahs, shhhs, shrill shrieks, and purrs together. And their voicings are often similar to their soundings, with call-and-response vocalization matched with contrapuntal instrumentation or sustained bowings matched with held singing. And finally the structures seem to culminate in harmony: “Big Space Little Nothing” ends with Kohl and Stewart phasing into vocal harmony; “Toothpick Bicycle” begins with the cello and violin varying their cadences to phase in and out of harmony; and “Honey Not Sweet” sees their voicings obtain a pulsing resonance together."" - Keith Prosk, Free Jazz Blog

While they had never played together before, each musician quickly found ways to complement the other’s approach. While past recordings indicate that rousay has ample chops as a conventional kit drummer, she currently uses two drums, some small gongs and metal bowls, and various found objects to create assemblages of perpetually changing sound. Genetti is a vocalist who has been searching out the common source where language and music converge for decades. At one point rousay echoed Genetti’s electronically distorted, back-of-the-throat rasps with slurps from her whiskey glass; at another, the friction between lullaby-like coos and scraped drum heads generated a tension that could not be denied."" - Bill Meyer, Magnet Magazine

Tashi Dorji & Tyler Damon,Both Will Escape,"""Enter Damon and Dorji, a dynamic duet of percussion and electric guitar. On Both Will Escape, they combine to create a visceral, mysterious, and surprising set of improvisation that maxes out the recording’s mix. Damon burns across his drum kit like a wildfire, firing timbres from a slew of raw materials and harnessing their energies into beats. At times, he pares the texture down, tending to cymbal whispers with his brushes. Dorji’s guitar tones similarly range from meditative to ecstatic, as he works minimalist ostinatos into coarse masses of noise. The result is an ideal sonic accompaniment to autumn’s vibrant colour scheme."" - Elizabeth Newton, The Quietus

"Lao Dan with Paul Flaherty, Randall Colbourne & Damon Smith",Live at Williamantic Records,"The opening minutes of the first track, “Noise & Light,” dispel any notion that Dan is an outsider in this session. His approach on alto saxophone, which remains his primary ax throughout the record, is cut from the cloth of the free jazz tradition; this may be in part due to his childhood exposure to American jazz records. He and Flaherty make up a formidable frontline. They explore all the vagaries of tone and texture; Flaherty carves amorphic figures with his sandpaper tone while Dan peels paint from the walls with his altissimo screams. Colbourne and Smith co-captain rhythmic duties that fluctuate opportunistically - everything from an off-kilter swing, to emptying-out-the-kitchen-drawer kind of clatter. It’s a rowdy event, and you know they’re all having a helluva good time."" - Taylor McDowell, Free Jazz Blog

Jim O'Rourke & Loren Connors,Two Nice Catholic Boys,"""Maybe it's easier to spot O'Rourke when he plays in a duo. But even then, he often fits his talents snugly inside those of his chosen partner. That was true of his first duo CD with Loren Connors, In Bern, and it's equally true of Two Nice Catholic Boys, recorded during the same 1997 European tour as In Bern. Part of the credit, of course, is due to Connors. His keen collaborative ear is as sharp as O'Rourke's, and his minimal guitar style, with its patient pace and open air, feels tailor-made for collaboration. Still, on all three pieces here, you can hear Connors' patented sound instantly, while O'Rourke's styles are slippier and sneakier, more cleverly camouflaged."" - Marc Masters, Pitchfork

Akira Sakata & Chikamorachi,Live at Hungry Brain,"""But happily, in the past half-decade or so Sakata has rediscovered his focus and killer sound. I don't know if former Chicagoan Jim O'Rourke is responsible for this shift, but he's been playing with and producing records for Sakata, enlisting two American colleagues—drummer Chris Corsano and bassist Darin Gray—as his working band, Chikamorachi. On Friendly Pants (Family Vineyard), the first Sakata recording released stateside in decades, the reedist unleashes plenty of sinus-clearing torrents, but his playing also reveals a refreshing compositional logic and lyrical tenderness. O'Rourke stays behind the board, spotlighting what an effective, empathetic trio Chikamorachi has become."" - Peter Margasak, Chicago Reader.

Akira Sakata & Chikamorachi with Masahiko Satoh,Proton Pump,"""Sakata starts the album alone, playing an Ornette-ish figure on alto sax that could be taken as a suggestion of common ground. Satoh quickly picks up on the figure and begins elaborating it. The pianist wastes no time establishing a crucial different in their approaches; while Sakata favors mercurial, winding lines, Satoh has a lot of time for sharp angles. Bridging the gap between fluidity and rigidity are bassist Darin Gray and drummer Chris Corsano, collectively known as Chikamorachi. They’ve been playing with Sakata for the better part of a decade, and they have developed a solid rapport that enables them to hang with his quick changes in direction and volume."" - Bill Meyer, Dusted Magazine.

Ben Bennett / Zoots Houston / Fred Lonberg-Holm,Pinkie No,"""Notice Recordings’ Chicago origins were heavily galvanized by regularly seeing sets by cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm and multi-instrumental improviser Zoots Houston. Both have since separately relocated to Kingston, NY, where they continue to engage with the kinds of musical exchanges exemplified here. This set, recorded live at Chicago’s Elastic Arts, finds them performing with percussionist Ben Bennett. Bennett, a musician and performance artist, is a notable figure in the current and vibrant free improv and jazz scene in NYC; recent collaborations include Michael Foster and Jack Wright, among others. All three players metaphorically deconstruct their instruments while scattering pockets of agitated hot air on the performance floor, augmented with pedals, radioesque static sweeps, tightly propelled breaths, and extended techniques. This is dry, heavily structural, bristling stuff, with periodic digressions into melody and a strong control of focused and at times uncomfortably magnified timbres. Much of the material is urgent and electronic, filling the space and remaining firmly gestural. These two sidelong sets display slices of time coming from strong voices within this niche of contemporary improvisation."" - Notice Recordings

Sarah Hennies & Greg Stuart,Rundle,"""Sarah Hennies and Greg Stuart have both primarily been known as percussionists, and although Hennies has lately been exploring more performance art and conceptual modes of expression, their work on Rundle reminds us of their strong voices within minimal improvisation. Subtly employing a broad palette of expertly recorded sounds, they move through a series of aural events and sequences of beguiling complexity. Also working as two-thirds of the trio Meridian, Hennies and Stuart share a strong sense of direction, making deeply assured choices that move in and out of narrative and coherence without betraying dynamic limits. The pair create distinctive and purposeful music that pushes against the boundaries of contemporary minimal performance."" - Notice Recordings

Jason Kahn & Tim Olive,Fukuoka / Osaka,"""Kahn and Olive both demonstrate exceptional attention to unrecognized sounds (see Kahn's ongoing Unheard Cities project), and one of the unique attributes of these pieces is their ability to make sounds whose sources, even with limited tools, aren't quite placeable. Their sound palette occasionally finds tension between understood words and speech as sound: hearing a sound that may or may not be speech, and speech that may or may not be understandable. They possess a unique resourcefulness on this release that makes it a surprising listen."" - Notice Recordings
