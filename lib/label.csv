Joanna Mattrey,Veiled,"""The second half starts with ""A mouthful of dirt"" which wails its lament from the start before briefly (suddenly) receding into a hushed micro-dialogue and a powerful reprise. I think the next piece, ""Come to bury to exhume"" is my favorite of the collection. Though there is constant motion I feel like so much more is hinted at than actually played. Almost like pieces are missing, but enough is given to discern their shapes. The short ""Grey Eyes"" cuts an icy figure against the previous piece, setting it's jarring pizzicato to a continuous, brittle scrape of rosined hair. ""For the Thrall"" starts out playfully percussive, gradually layering on warped abstractions that squeak, hiccup, and howl. The closer ""Descant"" is the final and longest piece of the collection. The first half of the dirge is mostly build-up, with Mattrey working momentum into her static arco before pushing into more uncertain territory where, similar to ""Come to bury to exhume"", she shades in darkness to elevate the light. Fantastic."" - Nick Metzger, Free Jazz Blog

Tim Berne | Nasheet Waits,The Coandā Effect,"""It's not exactly free improvisation, as it's clear throughout that Berne is drawing from themes and phrases from which he extrapolates longer, winding digressions; but Waits is so skillful in traversing Berne's unique pathways while leaving plenty of room for new developments that the music seems inherently fresh and undetermined. There's a sense that anything can happen. Of the album's two tracks, the forty-minute ""Tensile"" is the most impressive, with Berne moving through a handful of set pieces that serve as launching pads for his and Waits' musings. Ranging from lilting to torrid to deeply soulful, it displays the full scope of Berne's facility on alto, and Waits' similar ability to shift registers is noteworthy. He relies especially on his toms, which have a compelling tunefulness that renders his instrument a perfect complement for Berne, whether in his languorous or his more extroverted moments."" - Troy Dostert, All About Jazz

Erin Rogers,Dawntreader,"""Dawntreader is her first solo release and while I came into it cold, it won me over with its broad range of dynamics and timbre. On ""Beacon"" Rogers explores the tenor's upper register, twisting her piercing multiphonic yelps and whimpers against themselves in long segments of circular breathing intercut with well-timed and perfunctory silences. On several of the latter passages she vocalizes long glissandos as she plays, which result in powerful and sublime resonances that sound as though they might explosively flower the bell of her horn at any moment. The aptly titled ""Surface Tension"" bubbles with breathy swells and reed pops that create a palpable sense of anxiety, especially over the first half of the piece. One of the things I enjoy the most about the piece is that you can almost feel the vibrations from her horn. It becomes malleable in her hands, a medium as fluid as the air it wields."" - Nick Metzger, Free Jazz Blog

James Brandon Lewis,An UnRuly Manifesto,"""But this isn’t a concept album—it’s a work of immediacy and engagement. Without even offhand reference to spirituality, Lewis leads his ensemble down paths of ferocious polyphony that Albert Ayler and John Coltrane took for transcendence. He’s more secular. Peace, for Lewis, seems to be a matter of grappling with issues in the here and now, a grounded aesthetic stance like that of Archie Shepp or Sonny Rollins. Trumpeter Jaimie Branch, on Lewis’ first album featuring another horn player, stays close to him, adding swaggering gestures, bleats, blurts and Don Cherry-esque clarion calls. The rhythm section, a power unto itself, is back from Lewis’ No Filter. Bassist Luke Stewart, while establishing himself, ably evokes Lewis’ past collaborator, Jamaaladeen Tacuma, as well as Haden. Drummer Warren Trae Crudup III’s slap-happy fills drive the ensemble, his busyness a productive goad. Guitarist Anthony Pirog comes up with fascinating backgrounds, wild effects and sweet leads (for instance, at the end of “Notes”). Lest we forget jazz was forged by breaking norms, An Unruly Manifesto celebrates the aspirations, complications and results of freedom."" - Howard Mandel, Downbeat

Magda Mayas & Jim Denley,Tempe Jetz,"""The duo projects organic minimalism amid the sounds of nature and bizarre tone poems that move forward in asymmetrical fashion. At times Mayas seems to be tinkering with the innards of her clavinet as Denley counterbalances and tints many of these fragmented motifs with otherworldly sounds, where the trajectories are either solemn, nervy, peaceful or droning. The field recordings are melded somewhere in between or in the background and not always easy to detect. Hence, the musicians execute a musical jigsaw puzzle of sorts but are apt to lull you into a groove."" - Glenn Astarita, All About Jazz

Michael Foster / Michael Zerang / Katherine Young,Bind the Hand(s) That Feed,"""I think it’s worth stressing that extended techniques/preparations aren’t used here as highlights, as punctuation, or to add color. They are the name of the game. It’s almost like listening to an alien species, and the deeper you listen, the more you are rewarded. There is an uncommon depth to the music, mainly due to the proficiency of the artists at improvising with these sorts of sounds. It doesn’t seem as if there’s any real-time experimentation going on, at least none that I can discern (the phrase ‘I meant to do that’ keeps coming to mind). The musicians have such fluency in this style of improvisation that the resulting album borders on some sort of magic. What at first seems like chaotic, punitive noise transforms itself into something sublime with a bit of concentration, comparable to a sonic autostereogram. No doubt about it, this will be a difficult record for some, but it’s also a very special one. On first listen you may think I’ve lost it, but keep listening, I’m confident that you’ll see what I mean."" - Nick Metzger, Free Jazz Blog

Zeena Parkins • Wobbly,Triplicates,"""Triplicates is a series of improvisations between Zeena Parkins, playing her singular electric harp, and Jon Leidecker, aka Wobbly, playing an instrument that generates electrical feedback. Their outputs are routed to a series of simple listening devices, machines designed to sing along with the melodies they believe themselves to be hearing, although they are often fascinatingly wrong. It quickly becomes difficult to determine the boundaries of each participant's contribution: acoustic source, electronic conductor, or triplicate."" - Relative Pitch

Christine Abdelnour & Chris Corsano,Quand Fond La Neige - Où Va Le Blanc,"""On this disc, whose title translates roughly as ""where does the white go when the snow melts?"", Abdelnour and Corasano meet to construct a fungible universe of sonic interplay. Tactile even. ""Opening Umbrellas Indoors"" pits pitched wind — more trumpet than sax — against a repeating weird rasp that rises in pitch very quickly before dying out. All this amid held gurgle and flanging metals. A riveting introduction and an announcement of what's to come. The textures on display, along with the rapidly evolving rhythmic interplay should hold the listener's attention like a vice. An explosion of high-pitched information during ""Sparrow's Tea"" is frantically beautiful and the duo develop it by manipulating the timbre in such a way that the whole enterprise seems to be spinning around the room. Dropped into the middle of this display one would be hard-pressed to name what instruments were gushing this amazing dialogue. It is very often the case with this recording. ""Below The Hull"" pairs moisture and thumps, and ""The Mended Lid"" displays Morse code wind and head-high squeal in high speed discourse. When the pair do eventually resort to more ""normal"" sounding sax/drum interplay (""Sitting Still While the House Next Door Burns""), it comes as a surprise, another facet of their constructions. Turn the diamond in your fingers and listen to the the light dance."" - Jeph Jerman

Dustin Laurenzi,Snaketime: The Music of Moondog,"The brilliance of Moondog’s work, Laurenzi’s abilities as an organizer (a bandleader), and the individual strengths of the contributors, who solo and interact like undisputed heavyweight champions (but agile!) is evident throughout, but it’s “Fiesta Piano Solo” that registers as Snaketime’s centerpiece. The playing builds to a raucous peak (befitting the free jazz atmosphere) but never crosses over into the formidable, with the audience applause heard at a few points on the record indicative of an evening of collective joy. But it’s the emphasis on melody and the obvious respect for Moondog’s compositional structures that makes Snaketime: The Music of Moondog stand out all the more, as the pleasure in organized spontaneity (for the players and those witnessing) captured at the Hungry Brain easily extends to the stereo environment today and assuredly for more many tomorrows."" - Joseph Neff, Vinyl District

Mars Williams,An Ayler Xmas Vol 4: Chicago vs. NYC,"""One would think that a combination of Ayler and Xmas music would be a disaster of global proportions. But it is not. In fact, Ayler’s outside-oriented tunefulness can be directly applied to traditional melodies, such as The 12 Days of Christmas, Jingle Bells, Carol of the Bells, and so on. In addition to making this astute observation, Williams also arranges medleys of these pieces, reinterpreted with free jazz interludes and blowouts. Thus, on these recordings, the holiday spirit pokes its head out from time to time but gets immediately smashed by Williams’ hammer of musical blasphemy. You hear twinges of the Xmas music, a lot of Ayler, all put together in an irreverent – and yet joyous – fashion."" - Mike Borella, Avant Music News

Spires That In The Sunset Rise,House Ecstatic (Cover Your Blood),"""Spires That in the Sunset Rise, the duo composed of Ka Baird and Taralie Peterson, has been around since 2001, which is crazy, because that was eighteen years ago now, and also 9/11 happened then (#NeverForget). Somebody compared them to Sun City Girls once, and who am I to judge. (Oh right, music critic. Still, carry on.) Now, on their first release for Astral Spirits, the duo get ""ecstatic,"" that is, ""House Ecstatic,"" the name of this tape, which has a subtitle, ""(Cover Your Blood),"" that I guess helps us line up our expectations a little bit. See, each track is titled ""X stat [number],"" like each one is a hit to the bloodstream, and each piano trill and sax blurt and clarinet run and flute ... jab (?) spikes through your heartbeat like adrenalized lightning. There's the blood! Ecstasy in the blood. There are weird chant-y voices on here too, which sort of heighten the playfulness of this partnership at points, like when they meet the shaker percussion on ""X stat twentyfive,"" for example. In the end, the pairing of Spires and Astral Spirits is perfect, and why hasn't it happened sooner, I wonder? Seriously, somebody tell me."" - Ryan Masteller, Tabs Out

Shiroishi / Golia / Fujioka / Cline,Borasisi,"""When done properly, a recording with two drummers can be exquisite, and that is exactly what Fujioka and Cline provide. They effectively merge to the point where it is virtually impossible for the listener to tell where one starts and the other stops. Their long duet at the beginning of Left Eye Moon exemplifies this point, an ever-shifting rhythmic non-pattern that is wildly unpredictable. Whether intentional or not, this 32-minute album represents a pairing of collaborators from two different generations of free improv – Golia and Cline being the elder statesmen while Shiroishi and Fujioka represent the growing millennial contribution to this loose genre. But there is no sense of passing the torch. Instead, Borasisi is a cooperative alliance of equals – four accomplished improvisers who know how to bring the best out of themselves and each other."" - Mike Borella, Avant Music News

Phicus,Solid,"""""Solid"" is a very different album but not only because the songs are named after molecular or atomic substance whose natural abundance is in solid-state. The music keeps its exploratory nature and is full of ""fake"" sounds, yet it belongs more to the avant-garde guitar'n'bass'drums genre. But it should neither be viewed like Fred Frith's Massacre or Derek Bailey's ""Guitar, Drums 'n' Bass"", as they both have very ""traditional"" rhythmic structures, nor should it be viewed as the music of the trios plus saxophone like ""Last Exit"" with Peter Brotzmann, Bill Laswell, Ronald Shannon Jackson and Sonny Sharrock, or Human Feel with Chris Speed, Andrew D'Angelo, Jim Black and Kurt Rosenwinkel. In this sense, Phicus is much more avant-garde, free improvising and complex. The drums and percussion do generate rhythms, but completely free. There are short fragments when one can evoke the middle parts of Jimi Hendrix' ""Star Spangled Banner"", but these are also very concise. In short, there is nothing comparable to this music, period."" - Maciej Lewenstein.

Adam Caine Quartet,Transmissions,"""""Night Driver"" has a lyric two-guitar head melody that sounds vaguely Jerry Garcia-ish-meets-ECM but then in a B section a lovely contrasting chordal motif. Straight after it's off to the short solos including Adam Lane sounding very fresh. ""Cloud Over"" has Elvin Jones-ish swing and a two-guitar head melody that meshes wonderfully well in bluesy lyricism. The guitar solos built over a loosely together propulsion sound a little post-Jerry again while they rock jazzishly. With second guitar comping very nicely the Caine guitar solos  to me in a very hip way. It all moves beyond in another sort of post-Dead fullness. This is as fine an electric outing as I've heard this year. It has a thoughtful air about it, and at the same time wails out with feeling when it needs to. A guitar joy, this is!

Juan Vinuesa Jazz Quartet,Blue Shots From Chicago,"""Blue Shots from Chicago isn't as rough as Ornette!, the album is much more accessible, the heads are more melodic and mellow, the improvisations less overbearing. Vinuesa's sax is fierce and excited, and provided with a kind of epiphanic overtones, but then as well cool in the style of Lee Konitz. Roebke's bass is skillful as it is equipped with a tilting, creeping subtlety. Avery is a very reliable swinging drummer, but he can also play freely (e.g. in “In Paul's Mirror“). Josh Berman is the most seductive musician throughout, charmingly he adds short moments that could pass as swinging blues (especially in “Red Line Ballad“). He simply sounds wonderful here – contributing some heartbreaking moments. If you think this sounds cheesy, there are always enough skronks in between to avoid monotony or sentimentality."" - Martin Schray, Free Jazz Blog.

Billy Bang / William Parker,Medicine Buddha,"""Bang plays a slow, rapturous melody over an arco bass drone in the title track, before leaving Parker to his own devices. With bow in hand the bassist fuses gentle and rough sonorities in a solo that could be described as career defining. His partner returns with equally furious bowing that opens new textural pathways for the violin. Before you realize it, 22 minutes have flown by. Bang later switches to kalimba on one track and Parker picks up both the shakuhachi and the stringed dousn gouni, all adding to the expanse of their dialogue. Rather than improvising the whole set, they also perform two Parker compositions. “Eternal Planet” is a flowing piece that pays tribute to the late violinist Leroy Jenkins. Unlike the rest of the set, the closing “Buddha’s Joy” builds on a steady bass vamp, showing the duo was just as comfortable inside as outside."" - Mike Shanley, Jazz Times.

Joe McPhee,Alone Together: The Solo Ensemble Recordings 1974 & 1979,"""In his upstate NY secret laboratory, home-based in Poughkeepsie, Joe McPhee diligently documented his activities throughout the '70s, with the help of Craig Johnson, the producer who started CjR as an outlet for McPhee's music. Among the unreleased tapes waxed in that span, Alone Together is unique and especially beautiful. Like Sound on Sound (released by Corbett vs. Dempsey in 2010), these recordings make use of multitrack recording, overdubbing McPhee upon McPhee, however where those earlier recordings had an experimental tendency, the Alone Together tracks were more compositional in nature, allowing the multi-instrumentalist to build and sculpt each piece, creating complete wind ensembles one track at a time. In 1974 and then again in a longer session in 1979, McPhee recorded in concise solo, duo, and trio contexts, and in more extensive brass and reed quartets – all McPhee, all the time. Going head-to-head with the best of the saxophone foursomes of the era, McPhee is a one-man-WSQ, his probing investigations and lyrical statements as incisive and insightful as those of his best-known recordings."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey

The bassist unfurls deep, woody lines and the drummer peppers his flow with wonderfully jarring, chaotic accents, but despite the turbulence they forge an inexorable sense of forward motion, providing a platform for the cornetist to toggle masterfully between lyric flurries and knotted outbursts. Unlike the airtight miniatures on A Dance and a Hop, these pieces allow the players to resituate the same language onto a wide-open plane—pushing and pulling in changing directions and allowing spontaneous motifs to play out fully, although each musician never lets any single notion overstay it’s welcome."" - Peter Margasak

He now joyfully resides just outside of Tulsa, OK, surrounded by old oak trees and a host of wildlife. His music practice focuses on the sonic expansion of the steel-string acoustic guitar through improvisation and minimalist structures/processes. Instead of simply defying the constraints of the guitar, Nathan uses its limitations and traditions as viable sources for creation. Nathan’s personal vocabulary is informed by jazz, free improvisation, acoustic phenomena, and a repertoire of folk songs—drawing upon an excitement for the unknown and the sense of nostalgia and joy in the diverse sounds of American music traditions.""

Macie Stewart & Lia Kohl,Pocket Full of Bees,"""I think of Pocket Full of Bees as practices in approaching harmony and resonance with the self, the instrument, and one another. The similar timbres of the violin and cello further compliment each other by employing similar technique simultaneously. Both saw, radiating overtones, and Kohl’s droning propeller plane is met with Stewart’s whistling tea kettle on “Big Space Little Nothing;” Kohl and Stewart tap the strings with the bow, bow below the bridge, and strike the strings on “Toothpick Bicycle;” and the cello and violin fall into a rhythmic pluck together on “There’s Something In My Sock (It’s Good).” Like their soundings, their voicings are often similar to each other timbrally and technically, with both emitting oohs, eees, aaahs, shhhs, shrill shrieks, and purrs together. And their voicings are often similar to their soundings, with call-and-response vocalization matched with contrapuntal instrumentation or sustained bowings matched with held singing. And finally the structures seem to culminate in harmony: “Big Space Little Nothing” ends with Kohl and Stewart phasing into vocal harmony; “Toothpick Bicycle” begins with the cello and violin varying their cadences to phase in and out of harmony; and “Honey Not Sweet” sees their voicings obtain a pulsing resonance together."" - Keith Prosk, Free Jazz Blog

Carol Genetti & claire rousay,Live at Elastic Arts,"""The first set brought together transgender Texan percussionist claire rousay and local vocalist Carol Genetti. While they had never played together before, each musician quickly found ways to complement the other’s approach. While past recordings indicate that rousay has ample chops as a conventional kit drummer, she currently uses two drums, some small gongs and metal bowls, and various found objects to create assemblages of perpetually changing sound. Genetti is a vocalist who has been searching out the common source where language and music converge for decades. At one point rousay echoed Genetti’s electronically distorted, back-of-the-throat rasps with slurps from her whiskey glass; at another, the friction between lullaby-like coos and scraped drum heads generated a tension that could not be denied."" - Bill Meyer, Magnet Magazine

John Kolodij,First Fire • At Dawn,"""For First Fire • At Dawn, Kolodij left the High Aura’d banner behind in favor of his given name, but his instrumentals still follow in the transportive tradition of his earlier pieces. As with a lot of amorphous music, there’s certainly joy in just drifting along to the slow-panning movements of the record’s two side-long pieces, following the arc from noise to melody and back again. But First Fire • At Dawn is special, even among Kolodij’s accomplished catalog, because of the delight it seems to take in small, transitory details, the shimmery liminal spaces that naturally emerge as its tracks build and boil."" - Colin Joyce, Pitchfork

Alan Licht,YMCA,"YMCA is guitarist Alan Licht's first solo release since 2003's A New York Minute double CD (on XI), and his first solo vinyl outing since 1994's long out-of-print Sink the Aging Process (on Siltbreeze). Largely recorded at a 2004 concert at a Cambridge Massachusetts YMCA , the album documents Licht's solo guitar set of the time -- a three-part structured improvisation that moves from mournful, layered sustained tones that sound more like a reed organ than a guitar, to a gently plucked middle section, to a final firestorm of loop processing that is a tour de force of ""the changing same."" - Family Vineyard

Little Howlin' Wolf,Cool Truth,"""Full of random percussion, tone-less bass, obscured drones, simmering guitars, and barely recognizable, often unintelligible vocalizations, this is far from easy listening. Sounding as though multiple songs are being played simultaneously, often in different styles, it’s a heady mix of sounds that refuse easy classification. Unlike the works of Moondog or even Wesley Willis whose output, while certainly idiosyncratic bordering on the esoteric, at least held certain steadfast reference points, the music of Little Howlin’ Wolf is such a swirling olio it defies rote genre classification and easy cataloging."" - John Paul, Pop Matters

Paul Flaherty,Aria Nativa,"""Aria Nativa is more than Paul Flaherty's third solo saxophone album; it merges rhapsodic avant garde music, patriotic dream verse, and mortality into a frighteningly pure work of audio, visual and literary sledge. Recorded during a pair of 2007 performances, its four pieces capture lifeblood in stunning detail from foot stomps to gut hollers and crowd roars as Flaherty's free power blues dips into the well of wretchedness yet emerges with pumping fists of mirth. It's the sorta record that splays naked the artist for all: equal parts wise ass and universal vision."" - Family Vineyard.

Tashi Dorji & Tyler Damon,Both Will Escape,"""Enter Damon and Dorji, a dynamic duet of percussion and electric guitar. On Both Will Escape, they combine to create a visceral, mysterious, and surprising set of improvisation that maxes out the recording’s mix. Damon burns across his drum kit like a wildfire, firing timbres from a slew of raw materials and harnessing their energies into beats. At times, he pares the texture down, tending to cymbal whispers with his brushes. Dorji’s guitar tones similarly range from meditative to ecstatic, as he works minimalist ostinatos into coarse masses of noise. The result is an ideal sonic accompaniment to autumn’s vibrant colour scheme."" - Elizabeth Newton, The Quietus

"Lao Dan with Paul Flaherty, Randall Colbourne & Damon Smith",Live at Williamantic Records,"The opening minutes of the first track, “Noise & Light,” dispel any notion that Dan is an outsider in this session. His approach on alto saxophone, which remains his primary ax throughout the record, is cut from the cloth of the free jazz tradition; this may be in part due to his childhood exposure to American jazz records. He and Flaherty make up a formidable frontline. They explore all the vagaries of tone and texture; Flaherty carves amorphic figures with his sandpaper tone while Dan peels paint from the walls with his altissimo screams. Colbourne and Smith co-captain rhythmic duties that fluctuate opportunistically - everything from an off-kilter swing, to emptying-out-the-kitchen-drawer kind of clatter. It’s a rowdy event, and you know they’re all having a helluva good time."" - Taylor McDowell, Free Jazz Blog

Jim O'Rourke & Loren Connors,Two Nice Catholic Boys,"""Maybe it's easier to spot O'Rourke when he plays in a duo. But even then, he often fits his talents snugly inside those of his chosen partner. That was true of his first duo CD with Loren Connors, In Bern, and it's equally true of Two Nice Catholic Boys, recorded during the same 1997 European tour as In Bern. Part of the credit, of course, is due to Connors. His keen collaborative ear is as sharp as O'Rourke's, and his minimal guitar style, with its patient pace and open air, feels tailor-made for collaboration. Still, on all three pieces here, you can hear Connors' patented sound instantly, while O'Rourke's styles are slippier and sneakier, more cleverly camouflaged."" - Marc Masters, Pitchfork

I don't know if former Chicagoan Jim O'Rourke is responsible for this shift, but he's been playing with and producing records for Sakata, enlisting two American colleagues—drummer Chris Corsano and bassist Darin Gray—as his working band, Chikamorachi. On Friendly Pants (Family Vineyard), the first Sakata recording released stateside in decades, the reedist unleashes plenty of sinus-clearing torrents, but his playing also reveals a refreshing compositional logic and lyrical tenderness. O'Rourke stays behind the board, spotlighting what an effective, empathetic trio Chikamorachi has become."" - Peter Margasak, Chicago Reader.

Satoh quickly picks up on the figure and begins elaborating it. The pianist wastes no time establishing a crucial different in their approaches; while Sakata favors mercurial, winding lines, Satoh has a lot of time for sharp angles. Bridging the gap between fluidity and rigidity are bassist Darin Gray and drummer Chris Corsano, collectively known as Chikamorachi. They’ve been playing with Sakata for the better part of a decade, and they have developed a solid rapport that enables them to hang with his quick changes in direction and volume."" - Bill Meyer, Dusted Magazine.

Ben Bennett / Zoots Houston / Fred Lonberg-Holm,Pinkie No,"""Notice Recordings’ Chicago origins were heavily galvanized by regularly seeing sets by cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm and multi-instrumental improviser Zoots Houston. Both have since separately relocated to Kingston, NY, where they continue to engage with the kinds of musical exchanges exemplified here. This set, recorded live at Chicago’s Elastic Arts, finds them performing with percussionist Ben Bennett. Bennett, a musician and performance artist, is a notable figure in the current and vibrant free improv and jazz scene in NYC; recent collaborations include Michael Foster and Jack Wright, among others. All three players metaphorically deconstruct their instruments while scattering pockets of agitated hot air on the performance floor, augmented with pedals, radioesque static sweeps, tightly propelled breaths, and extended techniques. This is dry, heavily structural, bristling stuff, with periodic digressions into melody and a strong control of focused and at times uncomfortably magnified timbres. Much of the material is urgent and electronic, filling the space and remaining firmly gestural. These two sidelong sets display slices of time coming from strong voices within this niche of contemporary improvisation."" - Notice Recordings

Subtly employing a broad palette of expertly recorded sounds, they move through a series of aural events and sequences of beguiling complexity. Also working as two-thirds of the trio Meridian, Hennies and Stuart share a strong sense of direction, making deeply assured choices that move in and out of narrative and coherence without betraying dynamic limits.

Dudu Pukwana / Misha Mengelberg / Han Bennink ,Yi Yole,"""Recorded at the ICP Jubileum, a festival in Uithoorn, Holland, in 1978, Yi Yole brings together the core of the Instant Composers Pool – pianist Misha Mengelberg and drummer Han Bennink – with legendary South African alto saxophonist Dudu Pukwana. Longtime member of the Blue Notes, Pukwana was a beloved figure in European free music after he left South Africa in the mid-sixties and settled in London. There he worked with all of the leading lights of free improvised music, recording extensively with the Brotherhood of Breath and eventually releasing LPs under his own leadership before his untimely passing in 1990 at the age of 51. What the three tracks on Yi Yole make clear is how surprisingly well the Dutch and South African sensibilities fit together, an overall relaxed vibe leading to unforeseen directions in the music. Han Bennink ranges far beyond his drum kit and its metallic add-ons, playing trombone, clarinet, and viola; his collage design for the record, as with all ICP productions, is brilliant and perfectly matched to the music. This is the only time these three prime movers of free music would record as a trio, hitting just at the moment when the Instant Composers Pool was gaining momentum and South African jazz was growing in international stature. Released on ICP, Mengelberg/Bennink’s self-produced label, Yi Yole saw limited distribution and attention in its time, but it remains an absolute classic of improvised music, presented here in all its glory with Bennink’s design, remastered from original tapes, the box of which is reproduced on the interior spread, replete with never-seen hand notations."" - Corbett vs Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/yi-yole,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/dudu-pukwana-misha-mengelberg-han-bennink-yi-yole/s-JyorXHt0Gsp
ICP Tentet,Tetterettet,"""Recorded in 1977, the Instant Composers Pool’s Tetterettet is the first classic of the band’s larger incarnations. Assembled out of elements recorded live in Uithoorn, Utrecht, and the band’s home base of Amsterdam, with Misha Mengelberg using a cut-and-paste collage method akin to Teo Macero’swork with Miles Davis, the record features an all star lineup that added three leading lights of free music: bassist Alan Silva and saxophonists John Tchicai and Peter Brötzmann. In this period, Brötzmann made the long train trip from Wuppertal, Germany, to A’dam on a weekly basis to rehearse with ICP, bassist Silva coming in from Paris. Well known for his work in pioneer creative music ensembles such as the New York Art Quartet and the New York Contemporary Five and on John Coltrane’s Ascention, Tchicai was the Paul Desmond of free jazz, with a softer, more subtle phraseology than many of his peers. These international figures joined pianist Mengelberg and drummer Han Bennink – whose ICP co-founder Willem Breuker had broken off to form what would be come his long-time working band, the Kollektief – and their outrageous, hyper-inventive big band. Michel Waiswicz, who invented the crackle box, a user-friendly, portable electronic instrument, is a defining presence on Mengelberg’s multipart “Tetterettet,” and along with the heavyweight outta towners the band includes composer, oboist, and saxophonist Gilius Van Bergeyk, whose sequence of compositions nestle perfectly into Misha’s, Han’s gifted brother Peter Bennink on saxes, trombonist Bert Koppelaar, and cellist Tristan Honsinger, who has continued to work with the ensemble even after Misha’s death in 2017. One of the landmark records of Mengelberg tunes, with classics like “Rumboon” and “Alexander’s Marschbefehel,” Tetterettet presents a program full of musical surprises, intelligence, and ICP’s own brand of uproarious humor. A shaggy masterpiece, available here for the first time as a stand-alone CD, remastered from the original tapes, with Han Bennink’s original cover design and a contemporaneous photo from the archives of Gérard Rouy."" - Corbett vs Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/tetterettet,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/icp-tentet-tetterettet/s-boiCbVrLPXo
Misha Mengelberg / Peter Brötzmann / Evan Parker / Peter Bennink / Paul Rutherford / Derek Bailey / Han Bennink,Groupcomposing,"""Comprised of a one-time international free music supergroup, originally released as the sixth production on pianist Misha Mengelberg and drummer Han Bennink's ICP label, Groupcomposing has been largely absent from the history books. This is the case because the record has been so unavailable,certainly not as a comment on the magnitude and magnificence of the music. With its Bennink cover – take that Andy Warhol! – and its two side-long tracks, it is an improvised music aficionado's treasure. Mengelberg and Bennink are joined by Bennink's brother, Peter Bennink, on alto saxophone and bagpipes (!), with an incredible reed section of Evan Parker and Peter Brötzmann, Paul Rutherford on trombone, and Derek Bailey on guitar. Moving from peaks of intensity to droning deescalation, totally improvised live in concert in 1970, Groupcomposing should be heard in the company of related records like Brötzmann's Machine Gun and Nipples, the early London Jazz Composer's Orchestra and Globe Unity Orchestra, and Manfred Schoof's European Echoes. The music is reissued here for the first time as a stand-alone CD, with original album art and an interior salon of never-published period photographs by Gérard Rouy.

Willem Breuker / Han Bennink,New Acoustic Swing Duo,"""Late in 1967, saxophonist Willem Breuker and drummer Han Bennink recorded the first LP for the new artist-run free improvised music label, ICP Records. New Acoustic Swing Duo was an instant classic, and remains one of the most enduring documents of Dutch improvised music ever recorded. With Breuker’s omnidirectional reed work, which ranges from plaintive to excoriating, occasional sneering tone adds a kind of ironic twist to the expressive outpouring. He could be as explosive as Peter Brötzmann, but Breuker has a razor sharp wit and sense of humor. Since this recording, Bennink has gone on to be seated among the royalty of jazz and improvised music drummers. At the time, he was a fresh-faced 25-year-old, hauling around increasingly immense kits with heaps of percussion flotsam and jetsam, playing tabla and vibrapan, and sparking it all with tsunami energy. Keep in mind, Coltrane and Ali had just recorded Interstellar Space (which would not be issued until 1974), and the economical drum/sax lineup was by no means yet a standard in improvised music. Shortly after recording this, Breuker and Bennink would join Brötzmann to record Machine Gun, another European free music keystone. Somehow, despite its historical importance and aesthetic magnificence, New Acoustic Swing Duo has never been available as a stand-alone CD. Remastered from original tapes, this reissue includes the original cover with the “ICP 001” hand-stamp, as well as several versions of the handmade covers designed by Bennink, drawn from Mats Gustafsson’s wonderful collection. Finally, as a special bonus, the two-disc package includes a legendary concert by Breuker and Bennink, recorded in Essen, Germany, in 1968, released here for the first time."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/new-acoustic-swing-duo,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/willem-breuker-han-bennink-new-acoustic-swing-duo/s-bK8BWiEDkxu
Torbjörn Zetterberg & The Great Question,Live,"""If you’ve missed out on bassist Torbjörn Zetterberg, now’s your chance to play some catch up ball. He’s one of creative music’s most eloquent exponents, having emerged from the fertile Swedish jazz scene a little over 15 years ago. With his band Torbjörn Zetterberg Hot Five, he began a fruitful relationship with the thoroughly excellent Moserobie label, run by his frequent band mate, saxophonist Jonas Kullhammar, and by the time he was making records like Skildrar Kvinnans Kamp and Och Den Stora Frågen, we were completely hooked. Zetterberg is a Mingus for our times. He’s a composer of unusual means – great sense for how to harmonize his inventive melodies; how to make a sextet sound like a big band and how to clear space for an unaccompanied solo; his slightly devious sense of humor underlying all the drive and swing that make the best in a bass player; and best of all a respect for his musicians, who have always found ways to push his great compositions up a notch. This luminous set of tracks was recorded in performance at Stockholm’s famed Jazzclub Fasching. It presents a newly named ensemble, Torbjörn Zetterberg & The Great Question, with Kullhammar and Alberto Pinton on saxophones and clarinets, Portuguese trumpeter Susana Santos Silva, trombonist Mats Äleklint, and drummer Jon Fält. With the exception of the opening passage, which adapts the traditional “Cherry Tree Carol,” all compositions are by Zetterberg, and they make a solid case for him as a jazz writer to be taken seriously. Joyful, powerful, irreverent, and utterly fearless, The Great Question presents its case, answers the initial query, and asks more probing ones."" - Corbett vs. Dempsey",Corbett vs. Dempsey,https://corbettvsdempsey.bandcamp.com/album/live,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/torbjorn-zetterberg-the-great-question-live/s-xJy3F4xZfQn
RED trio,Suite 10 Years Anniversary,"""The Portugues RED Trio is without a doubt one of the best piano trios in Europe.  Now, four years later, we get this memorable album with the ""celebration band"", an ad hoc group of musicians, primarily also from Portugal but with the addition of some partners on the previous albums such as John Butcher and Matthias Ståhl. The other members are Sei Miguel and Luís Vicente on trumpet, Fala Mariam on trombone, Pedro Sousa and Rodrigo Amado on tenor saxophone, Nuno Torres on alto saxophone, Ernesto Rodrigues on viola, Ricardo Jacinto and Miguel Mira on cello, Carlos Santos on electronics, Miguel Abreu on voice and electric bass, and David Maranha on percussion. The performance was recorded to celebrate their tenth anniversary at the Teatro Maria Matos in February 2018. The theater itself commissioned the concert ""Suite"", a work in three acts, each written by one of the three founding members, and deliberately composed for the ensemble mentioned above."" - Stef Gijssels, Free Jazz Blog",No Business,http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/red-trio-suite-10-years-anniversary.html,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/red-trio-suite-10-years-anniversary/s-cRSYyIJAdMl
Derek Bailey / Mototeru Takagi,"Live At FarOut, Atsugi 1987","""Part of the initial group of Japanese free jazz players, Takagi ought to be far better known than he is. Starting out in percussionist Motoharu Yoshizawa’s trio in 1968, Takagi went on to play with key Japanese free improvisers like Masahiko Togashi, Masayuki Takayangi, Motoharu Yoshizawa, Itaru Oki, Toshinori Kondo and Sabu Toyozumi. From the late ‘60s on, this community of musicians began charting a collective approach to uncompromising freedom, increasingly collaborating with visiting free players from Europe and the US. Takagi was amongst those tapped when Milford Graves visited Japan in 1977 (documented on the album Meditation Among Us) and when Derek Bailey visited in 1978 (documented on the album Duo & Trio Improvisations). Bailey returned to Japan a number of times after that 1978 meeting, including the tour that resulted in this recording. When Bailey returned in 1987, he played some solos, duos with dancer Min Tanaka, and in a trio with Peter Brötzmann and percussionist Sabu Toyozumi as well as in this duo session with Takagi. The reed player sticks to soprano saxophone across the four expansive duos, a half hour opener, two 17-minute pieces, and a relatively compact 8-minute foray. Bailey’s electric guitar playing is in top form throughout, his lightning, refracted angular phrasing bursting with brittle resonance. One can readily hear why Bailey gravitated to Takagi. The reed player immediately hits with an acidic attack, starting with long tones that ring against Bailey’s harmonics, patiently building to lithe, spiky intensity. It’s always great to hear Bailey when he finds a potent foil, and the two clearly revel in the intertwined, parallel arcs that develop. Particularly over the course of the first piece, they take their time, probing, prodding, letting their respective lines course, ring against each other, unhurriedly unwind, only to lunge forth, bristling with skirling vigor, ending with Takagi looping a lyrical thread to close things out."" - Michael Rosenstein, Point of Departure",No Business,"http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/live-at-farout,-atsugi-1987-cd.html",https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/derek-bailey-mototeru-takagi-live-at-farout-atsugi-1987/s-N5eHrkj1tBi
Joe McPhee / Michael Zerang,Creole Gardens (A New Orleans Suite),"""In these recessionary times, the duet offers the optimum solution: the opportunity for dialogue and interaction, but with logistics and expense kept to a minimum. Of course, such strictures are nothing new for the avant-garde, those flowers which bloom between the cracks in the marginal wastelands. Multi-instrumentalist Joe McPhee's résumé includes more than its fair share of twosomes, with drummers forming a prominent strand. Recent partners include Hamid Drake, Paul Hession, Paal Nilssen-Love and Chris Corsano, but this encounter with Chicago-based Michael Zerang ranks among the most rewarding. It helps that both have a well of shared experience to draw upon, not least their 13 years together as integral parts of Peter Brötzmann's Chicago Tentet, and Zerang's role within McPhee's Survival Unit III trio. But it's not only about familiarity; a large degree of the success of this 60-minute live date recorded in New Orleans stems from how attuned they are to each other's intent. Zerang, in particular, probes, prods and cossets, bringing all his rhythmic acumen to bear. His easy paced tumbling cadences with their abundant pockets of space provide fertile soil in which McPhee can cultivate his patented mix of visceral abstractions and extemporized melodicism. McPhee continues to develop his use of vocalizations simultaneous with his playing. Used sparingly they pack a profound emotional kick, ranging from screams and overtones to choked cries. At the 15-minute mark in ""Congo Square Dances / Saints and Sinners,"" the saxophonist's hummed melodic line parallels a wavering whistle to invoke a touching vulnerability. At the start of the same piece, the pair illustrates a simpatico attitude to timbral exploration, the drummer accompanying McPhee's stuttering pocket trumpet with eerie moans created by dragging scrapers across his drum heads."" - John Sharpe, All About Jazz",No Business,http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/creole-gardens-(new-orleans-suite).html,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/joe-mcphee-michael-zerang-creole-gardens-a-new-orleans-suite/s-X7dOefjVGjT
Marilyn Lerner / Ken Filiano / Lou Grassi,Live at Edgefest,"""Rising On An Infrared Wave"" opens proceedings in accomplished style, co-opting silence as another member of the ensemble, to be interspersed between pellucid piano ripples, slashing arco and tinkling cymbals. Eventually the colloquy congeals first into a stop start unison, then a concerted surge. Textural interchange occupies a prominent role, especially on ""Open Cluster"" in the dialogue between Filiano's abrasive sawing and Lerner's rubbing and scraping under the bonnet, which calls to mind Agusti Fernandez' celebrated expeditions inside the piano. On ""Event Horizon"" Grassi's intro leads to swirling trio interaction, Filiano's sweet nimble fingering latterly to the fore. Once he settles into a repeated vamp, Lerner initiates an incantatory spell, fuelled by rolling drums, in what proves the highlight of this fine date."" - John Sharpe, All About Jazz",No Business,http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/edgefest-lp.html,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/marilyn-lerner-ken-filiano-lou-grassi-live-at-edgefest/s-RbgyOIwSEvR
Peter Evans / John Butcher / Clayton Thomas / Paul Lovens / Frederic Blondy,A Wing Dissolved in Light,"""Then you put on A Wing Dissolved In Light, their first album, which was recorded at the 2013 Tampere Jazz Happening, and you’re surprised: The piece starts with first-class old-school free jazz. John Butcher shines with controlled overtones, bird chirps and alienated sounds, Peter Evans gets lost in a whirlwind of eccentric tones and circular breathing on his piccolo trumpet, Lovens propels the two providing a consequent cymbal pulse, Frédéric Blondy supports Lovens with isolated Taylor chords, while Clayton Thomas’ hectic bowed bass adds fuel to the fire. But above all, A Wing Dissolved In Light is a constant twist and turn, the music is permanently moving in different directions as to sound and dynamics. It slows down and explodes, especially in the quieter parts the musicians delve into sound explorations, their different approaches blend into one great collective effort. Indeed, there are wonderful moments, for example the duo passage of Evans and Thomas, who are joined by the others at an incredible speed, the almost classic piano trio part, and Evans’ and Butcher’s squeaking and gargling dialogue which prepares the ground for a tender and melancholic break. Here and there the music is reminiscent of an extended version of the Schlippenbach Trio because of Paul Lovens’ subtle control of things and John Butcher’s saxophone, which is sometimes close to Evan Parker’s style. A Wing Dissolved In Light is a very delightful and fascinating album for fans of both European improvised music of the 1970s and those who are interested in disregarding the apparent limitations of the instruments used in this band. It’s been one of my favorites in 2017 so far."" - Martin Schray, Free Jazz Blog",No Business,http://www.nobusinessrecords.com/anemone-a-wing-dissolved-in-light.html,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/evans-butcher-thomas-lovens-blondy-a-wing-dissolved-in-light/s-Uklduh9q7vt
Jeremiah Cymerman / Charlie Looker,A Horizon Made Of Canvas,"""A Horizon Made of Canvas is a bleak marvel, a journey through the creeping sensation that something new and unexplainable is around the corner. Sharing its name with the first chapter of a book by neo-reactionary writer Mencius Moldbug, the album presents sounds like a fog: dense yet sparse, seemingly unmovable and yet always in motion, a contradictory mass whose insides are empty. I felt nervous while listening to it, a strange bodily alert that was telling me I was somehow about to fall; A Horizon draws full attention through its slight, quiet tone and subtle instrumental dialogues, like a dread mystery unfolding, making it easy to lose oneself amidst the volumes spoken by its silences. It made me want to know where it was taking me, the clarinet’s voice a jeweled allure leading only deeper inside the fog, every step a nudge in paranoiac impulses – in the end, the place where it was taking me was simply nowhere."" - A Closer Listen",Astral Spirits,https://horizonmadeofcanvas.bandcamp.com/album/a-horizon-made-of-canvas,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/jeremiah-cymerman-charlie-looker-a-horizon-made-of-canvas/s-ma4JFlvAkcC
"Charles Rumback w/ Jim Baker, James Singleton & Greg Ward",Cadillac Turns,"""If you’d have asked Charles Rumback a couple of years ago what his next album would be like, he might have responded that it would be a lot like his last two. That is, the drummer leading his working trio with Jim Baker on piano and Greg Ward on sax, running through a set of fresh new Rumback compositions. But fate had other plans. At the urging of couple of musician friends, bassist James Singleton was added to the trio at the last minute for a planned performance at the 2017 Instigation Festival and family life precluded the intended introduction of new Rumback tunes; the newly expanded band was left recycling some of his old ones. Those live performances are preserved for the new Charles Rumback album that actually happened, Cadillac Turns. But first, a word about this late addition. James Singleton is the Ray Brown of New Orleans, the bassist who can be found on more meaningful sessions on recordings from NOLA – or heavily connected to it — than anyone else. His list of credits stretch from Irma Thomas and James Booker to Anders Osbourne and Rickie Lee Jones, and he’s a key member of New Orleans’ premier modern jazz combo, Astral Project. Of late, he’s appeared in the progressive jazz supergroup Nolatet."" S.

Charles Rumback w/ Jim Baker & John Tate,June Holiday,"""June Holiday is the group’s least aggressive, but the leader frequently builds in an exquisite sense of tension, pitting surface placidity against rumbling anxiety. All three musicians contribute tunes here, and most of them convey a distinct ballad-like feel. The tunefulness comes in spare, single-note tangles: Overtones hang in the air only to be juddered by spasmodic clusters of cymbals and toms, summoning something far more meaningful than an unabashed love song or a freak-out. Baker has been a key fixture on the Chicago scene for decades and June Holiday arguably could stand as his most impressive performance on a recording. His opening “Foglights” is suitably hazy, with Rumback’s sensitive, shuffling brushwork underlining a Herbie Nichols vibe, while the darting, broken-glass figures the pianist brings to “Huh?” evoke the sound of early Cecil Taylor—an off-kilter but unapologetic sense of swing pushing even the most abstract phrases forward."" - Peter Margasak, Downbeat",Astral Spirits,https://cadillacturns.bandcamp.com/album/june-holiday,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/charles-rumback-w-jim-baker-john-tate-june-holiday/s-kzkgajTzRlI
Roscoe Mitchell & Mike Reed,the Ritual and the Dance,"""The album was recorded in October of 2015 as part of the Oorstof concert series in Antwerp. The piece starts with Reed weaving sparse bits of percussion around Mitchell's irregular, probing sopranino squawk. These minor sounds quickly accumulate in frequency and velocity as the musicians lock into their heady and physical interplay. Reed is a spectacular drummer, a true lion of the skins he colors his crisp, flowing percussion with subtle and sometimes unexpected sounds. Here he puts on a clinic; the speed, power, and sharpness of his technique serve to soften his pummeling attack, but it is a pummeling nevertheless. Mitchell meets him right in the midst of his tempest, a swirling mass of razorwire sound piercing the din. Reed puts down his sticks and adds some light electronics as Mitchell continues working through his concept, then returns subtly and takes over as Mitchell inhales his first deep breath in a quarter hour. The rhythm relaxes and Reed stretches out, working over his toms and punctuating the maelstrom with violent cymbal work. His pace slows and there is a brief period where the duo employ a slightly more delicate measure. Mitchell, now on alto, plays long, wailing figures against the abstract rhythms of Reed. Mitchell's playing quickens as Reed briefly recoils before going in for the finish. Now on soprano, Mitchell peels off knotty, twisted passages within the barrage. The intensity wanes for a final time and Mitchell softly plays bells against Reed's thumping backbeat and the appreciative whoops of the crowd."" - Nick Metzger, Free Jazz Blog",Astral Spirits,https://astralmitchellreed.bandcamp.com/album/the-ritual-and-the-dance,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/roscoe-mitchell-mike-reed-the-ritual-and-the-dance/s-cP7r2MtpdHM

Signe Emmeluth,Hi Hello I’m Signe,"""Danish saxophonist Signe Emmeluth, who now lives in Oslo after studying in Trondheim, Norway, has made a strong impact on the European free music scene in the last couple of years, not only due to her ferocious sound, but also through a stylistic openness. Her rugged band Amoeba fulfils her compositional interests, while her duo with guitarist Karl Bjorå, Owl, which released a stunning 2020 debut called Mille Feuille, is more spare and contemplative. This solo outing — a single piece recorded live for Ingebrit Håker Flaten’s Sonic Transmissions Festival — contains its fair share of fire-breathing, with tart boppish phrases ricocheting toward the horizon in upper register sallies, but it opens and closes with finely etched restraint, as sibilant, snaking lines build and recede from and into nothingness.

Hali Palombo,Cylinder Loops,"""Hali Palombo’s Cylinder Loops is the first release of 2021 on Astral Editions and upon first glance it may look like a minor one: 12 loops clocking in at 18 minutes. Yet, I’ve been sitting with the loops for a month now and it might be the next keystone release for defining the label’s sound.  Palombo’s 2019 and 2020 works have been tinkering with shortwave radio ghosts and fragments; Cherry Ripe practically summons dispatches from the bomb shelters of the atomic era. Sometimes mournful or monolithic, yet with an undercurrent of warmth and bittersweetness to this era. On Cylinder Loops, Palombo takes a dozen fragments (courtesy of UCSB’s Cylinder Archive), highlighting the ghosts in those auditory fragments. Palombo’s loops will be quite familiar should you have a sweet tooth for Lelyand Kirby and Ghost Box (there lies a hauntology tag at the bottom of its bandcamp page). The cylinder loops have a wicked sense of space they conjure up. Demented carnivals (Loop 8), funeral liturgy (Loop 4), or flickering nitrate print (Loop 3) all provide images of a pre-WWI society on the fringe of a modernity it will soon be crushed under. Palombo then bends that sense of temporality; often pushing the sounds of these loops towards dispatches from futures akin to the dream worlds of Tim Hecker’s Harmony in Ultraviolet (Loop 6/9). The entire affair is precise, not a moment wasted. As a result, it lends itself both to trips across the midwest as much as a rainy morning lost in a foggy haze. You’ll best want to pick this one up before it fades away."" - Matty McPherson, Tabs Out",Astral Editions,https://aecylinderloops.bandcamp.com/album/cylinder-loops,https://soundcloud.com/user-861231864/sets/hali-palombo-cylinder-loops/s-yOYu1wH7xR5

Montgomery & Turner,Sounds Passing Through Circumstances,"""‘Drifting’ is the word I keep coming back to as I sail through Jayve Montgomery and Nick Turner’s Sounds Passing Through Circumstances. Duets for mellotron and flute and saxophone (with effects) that are weightless under starlit night skies as you watch your frozen breath float into the crisp, cold air. Montgomery and Turner are in tune with the harmony of the spheres. Each side-long piece gets deep into meditative hinterlands where thoughts turn inward. Emerald mists from Turner’s mellotron shroud Montgomery’s distant star gazing, his effects-laden flute growing into a web of light. Repetition wields a soft sword on “Circumstance 01,” with flickering, faint percussive elements providing the guideposts as the duo intertwines layers of cosmic, reverb-soaked sound. Montgomery takes off into the cosmos on “Circumstance 02,” piercing through the synthetic aural haze with passages of moving, reflective notes. Sequences of time fall into eternity as you lose yourself to the enveloping sonic stream of consciousness. Sounds Passing Through Circumstances is music for inner reflection. Close your eyes, open your heart and mind and new worlds will materialize. Sacred spaces are endless if you ride on these hypnotic, ethereal waves."" - Brad Rose, Foxy Digitalis

Anáhuac,Y_y,"""This trio, composed of Juan García (double bass), Ignaz Schick (turntable, sampler, electronics) and Chris Cogburn (electronic, percussion), has been using non-idiomatic improvisation since 2016 to propose a new way in which the audience can approach the concept of sound as an art form. That this album bears the word “ascua” (ember) as its title is quite appropriate, since both of its tracks seem to grow as more elements are thrown into them, just as if it were a sonic wood fire; there’s a hissing, static effect that persists throughout the album -like that of a dusty vinyl record- that effectively emulates the sound of something being slowly consumed by a small fire (as we can appreciate on “scoria”) or it might as well represent a liquid reaching its boiling point, as illustrated on “sudar” climax. This time, however, Anáhuac has found a way to use less elements, and the results are far more great, as every nuance and texture is more noticeable; this helps create a deeper sense of immersion. Each member’s contributions are minimal, but vital. This is not a demonstration of virtuosity or manual dexterity, nor it is a relentless attack on the senses: the purpose is not to trace complex melodic or harmonic contours, nor the careful and methodical confection of typical rhythmic patterns, but a fusion in favor of texture and the exploration of the timbral possibilities each element involved has to offer, while maintaining a sense of balance and direction."" - Densidad25
