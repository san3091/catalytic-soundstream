            The music streaming industry makes over ten billion dollars each year selling music made by more than a million artists. Despite their reliance on the creativity and labor of musicians, Spotify, Apple, Google, and other streaming services pay artists almost nothing, and treat musicians as replaceable cogs in a content-production machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Catalytic Soundstream is our solution to this systemic imbalance: a subscription-based, artist owned and curated streaming service that pays Catalytic Sound co-op musicians 2/3 of all streaming revenue.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Subscribers will enjoy a constantly shifting set of albums on the Soundstream each month: a Radio selection of thirty rotating albums chosen by Catalytic artists and staff, the continuing set of Catalytic Artist Album editions, and History Is What's Happening, a handpicked selection of records released before the new millennium. In the process they'll contribute to a new kind of music streaming service, one that provides an ongoing and equitable source of income for the musicians responsible for its creative content.
